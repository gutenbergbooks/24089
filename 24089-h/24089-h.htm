<h2>I<br/> THE DISCOVERY</h2>


<p class="dropcap">My Dear Jane,</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1em;">You remember that you were
puzzled when I told you I had heard something
from the owls&mdash;or if not puzzled (for
I know you have some experience of these
things), you were at any rate anxious to
know exactly how it happened. Perhaps
the time has now come for you to be told.</p>

<p>It was really luck, and not any skill of
mine, that put me in the way of it; luck,
and also being ready to believe more than
I could see. I have promised not to put
down on paper the name of the wood where
it happened: that can keep till we meet;
but all the rest I can tell exactly as it
came about.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
It is a wood with a stream at the edge of
it; the water is brown and clear. On the
other side of it are flat meadows, and beyond
these a hillside quite covered with an oak
wood. The stream has alder-trees along it,
and is pretty well shaded over; the sun hits
it in places and makes flecks of light through
the leaves.</p>

<p>The day I am thinking of was a very hot
one in early September. I had come across
the meadows with some idea of sitting by
the stream and reading. The only change
in my plans that I made was that instead
of sitting down I lay down, and instead of
reading I went to sleep.</p>

<p>You know how sometimes&mdash;but very, very
seldom&mdash;you see something in a dream
which you are quite sure is real. So it was
with me this time. I did not dream any
story or see any people; I only dreamt of
a plant. In the dream no one told me anything
about it: I just saw it growing under
a tree: a small bit of the tree root came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
into the picture, an old gnarled root covered
with moss, and with three sorts of eyes in it,
round holes trimmed with moss&mdash;you know
the kind. The plant was not one I should
have thought much about, though certainly
it was not one that I knew: it had no
flowers or berries, and grew quite squat
in the ground; more like a yellow aconite
without the flower than anything else. It
seemed to consist of a ring of six leaves
spread out pretty flat with nine points on
each leaf. As I say, I saw this quite clearly,
and remembered it because six times nine
makes fifty-four, which happens to be a
number which I had a particular reason for
remembering at that moment.</p>

<p>Well, there was no more in the dream
than that: but, such as it was, it fixed
itself in my mind like a photograph, and I
was sure that if ever I saw that tree root
and that plant, I should know them again.
And, though I neither saw nor heard anything
more of them than I have told you, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was borne in upon my mind that the plant
<em>was</em> worth finding.</p>

<p>When I woke up I still lay, feeling very
lazy, on the grass with my head within a
foot or two of the edge of the stream and
listened to its noise, until in five or six
minutes&mdash;whether I began to doze off again
or not does not much matter&mdash;the water-sound
became like words, and said, &ldquo;<em>Trickle-up,
trickle-up</em>,&rdquo; an immense number of times.
It pleased me, for though in poetry we hear
a deal about babbling brooks, and though
I am particularly fond of the noise they
make, I never was able before to pretend
that I could hear any words. And when I
did finally get up and shake myself awake
I thought I would anyhow pay so much
attention to what the water said as to
stroll up the stream instead of down. So I
did: it took me through the flat meadows,
but still along the edge of the wood, and
still every now and then I heard the same
peculiar noise which sounded like <em>Trickle-up</em>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Not so very long after, I came to a place
where another stream ran out of the wood
into the one I had been following, and just
below the place where the two joined there
was&mdash;not a bridge, but a pole across, and
another pole to serve as a rail, by which
you could cross, without trouble. I did
cross, not thinking much about it, but with
some idea of looking at this new little
stream, which went at a very quick pace and
seemed to promise small rapids and waterfalls
a little higher up. Now when I got to
the edge of it, there was no mistake: it
was saying &ldquo;<em>Trickle-up</em>,&rdquo; or even &ldquo;<em>Track-up</em>,&rdquo;
much plainer than the old one. I
stepped across it and went a few yards up
the old stream. Before the new one joined
it, it was saying nothing of the kind. I
went back to the new one: it was talking as
plain as print. Of course there were no two
words about what must be done now. Here
was something quite new, and even if I
missed my tea, it had got to be looked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
into. So I went up the new stream into the
wood.</p>

<p>Though I was well on the look-out for unusual
things&mdash;in particular the plant, which
I could not help thinking about&mdash;I cannot
say there was anything peculiar about the
stream or the plants or the insects or the
trees (except the words which the water
kept saying) so long as I was in the flat
part of the wood. But soon I came to a
steepish bank&mdash;the land began to slope up
suddenly and the rapids and waterfalls of
the brook were very gay and interesting.
Then, besides <em>Track-up</em>, which was now its
word always instead of <em>Trickle</em>, I heard
every now and then <em>All right</em>, which was
encouraging and exciting. Still, there was
nothing out of the way to be seen, look as
I might.</p>

<p>The climb up the slope or bank was fairly
long. At the top was a kind of terrace,
pretty level and with large old trees growing
upon it, mainly oaks. Behind there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was a further slope up and still more woodland:
but that does not matter now. For
the present I was at the end of my wanderings.
There was no more stream, and I had
found what of all natural things I think
pleases me best, a real spring of water quite
untouched.</p>

<p>Five or six oaks grew in something like
a semicircle, and in the middle of the flat
ground in front of them was an almost perfectly
round pool, not more than four or five
feet across. The bottom of it in the middle
was pale sand which was continually rising
up in little egg-shaped mounds and falling
down again. It was the clearest and
strongest spring of the kind I had ever seen,
and I could have watched it for hours. I
did sit down by it and watch it for some
time without thinking of anything but the
luck I had had to find it. But then I
began to wonder if it would say anything.
Naturally I could not expect it to say
&ldquo;<em>Track-up</em>&rdquo; any more, for here I was at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
end of it. So I listened with some curiosity.
It hardly made so much noise as the stream:
the pool was deeper. But I thought it
must say something, and I put my head
down as close as I could to the surface of
the water. If I am not mistaken (and as
things turned out I am sure I was right) the
words were: <em>Gather gather, pick pick</em>, or
<em>quick quick</em>.</p>

<p>Now I had not been thinking about the
plant for a little time; but, as you may
suppose, this brought it back to my mind
and I got up and began to look about at
the roots of the old oaks which grew just
round the spring. No, none of the roots
on this side which faced towards the water
were like that which I had seen&mdash;still, the
feeling was strong upon me that this, if any,
was the kind of place, and even the very
place, where the plant must be. So I walked
to the back of the trees, being careful to go
from right to left, according to the course
of the sun.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Well, I was not mistaken. At the back
of the middlemost oak-tree there were the
roots I had dreamt of with the moss and
the holes like eyes, and between them was
the plant. I think the only thing which
was new to me in the look of it was that it
was so extraordinarily <em>green</em>. It seemed to
have in it all the greenness that was possible
or that would be wanted for a whole field
of grass.</p>

<p>I had some scruples about touching it. In
fact, I actually went back to the spring and
listened, to make sure that it was still saying
the same thing. Yes, it was: &ldquo;<em>Gather
gather, pick</em>.&rdquo; But there was something else
every now and then which I could <em>not</em> for
the life of me make out at first. I lay
down, put my hand round my ear and held
my breath. It might have been <em>bark tree</em>
or <em>dark tree</em> or <em>cask free</em>. I got impatient
at last and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I'm very sorry, but do what I will I
<em>cannot</em> make out what you are trying to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Instantly a little spirt of water hit me on
the ear, and I heard, as clear as possible,
what it was: &ldquo;<em>Ask tree</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I got up at once. &ldquo;I <em>beg</em> your pardon,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;of course. Thank you very much;&rdquo;
and the water went on saying &ldquo;<em>Gather gather,
all right, dip dip</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After thinking how best to greet it, I
went back to the oak, stood in front of it
and said (of course baring my head):</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oak, I humbly desire your good leave to
gather the green plant which grows between
your roots. If an acorn falls into this my
right hand&rdquo; (which I held out) &ldquo;I will
count it that you answer yes&mdash;and give you
thanks.&rdquo; The acorn fell straight into the
palm of my hand. I said, &ldquo;I thank you,
Oak: good growth to you. I will lay this
your acorn in the place whence I gather
the plant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then very carefully I took hold of the
stalk of the plant (which was very short,
for, as I said, it grew rather flat on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
ground) and pulled, and to my surprise it
came up as easily as a mushroom. It had
a clean round bulb without any rootlets and
left a smooth neat hole in the ground, in
which, according to promise, I laid the acorn,
and covered it in with earth. I think it very
likely that it will turn into a second plant.</p>

<p>Then I remembered the last word of the
spring and went back to dip the plant in it.
I had a shock when I did so, and it was
lucky I was holding it firm, for when it
touched the water it struggled in my hand
like a fish or a newt and almost slipped out.
I dipped it three times and thought I felt it
growing smaller in my hand: and indeed
when I looked at it I found it had shut up
its leaves and curled them in quite close, so
that the whole thing was little more than
a bulb. As I looked at it I thought the
water changed its note and said, &ldquo;<em>That'll
do, that'll do</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought it was time to thank the spring for
all it had done for me, though, as you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
may suppose, I did not yet know in the
least what was to be done with the plant,
or what use it was going to be.</p>

<p>So I went over and said in the politest
words I could how much I was obliged,
and if there was anything I had or could
do which would be agreeable, how glad I
should be. Then I listened carefully, for it
seemed by this time quite natural that I
should get some sort of answer. It came.
There was a sudden change in the sound,
and the water said clearly and rapidly,
&ldquo;<em>Silver silver silver silver</em>.&rdquo; I felt in my
pocket. Luckily I had several shillings, sixpences
and half-crowns. I thought the best
way was to offer them all, so I put them
in the palm of my right hand and held
it under the water, open, just over the
dancing sand. For a few seconds the water
ran over the silver without doing anything:
only the coins seemed to grow very bright
and clean. Then one of the shillings was
very neatly and smoothly slid off, and then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
another and a sixpence. I waited, but no
more happened, and the water seemed to
draw itself down and away from my hand,
and to say &ldquo;<em>All right</em>.&rdquo; So I got up.</p>

<p>The three coins lay on the bottom of the
pool looking brighter than even the newest
I have ever seen, and gradually as they
lay there they began to appear larger. The
shillings looked like half-crowns and the
sixpence like a shilling. I thought for a
moment that it was because water magnifies,
but I soon saw that this could not be
the reason, for they went on growing larger,
and of course thinner, until they finally
spread into a kind of silver film all over
the bottom of the pool; and as they did so
the water began to take on a musical sound,
much like the singing that comes when you
wet your finger and draw it round the
edge of a finger glass at dessert (which some
people's idea of table manners allows them
to do). It was a pretty sight and sound,
and I listened and looked for a long time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
But all this time what had become of
the plant? Why, when I gave the silver to
the spring I had wrapped the plant carefully
in a silk handkerchief and put it safe in my
breast pocket. I took the handkerchief out
now, and for a moment I was afraid the
plant was gone; but it was not. It had
shrunk to a very small whity-green ball.
Now what was to be done with it, or rather
what could it do? It was plain to me that
it must have a strange and valuable property
or virtue, since I had been put on
its track in such a remarkable way. I
thought I could not do better than ask the
spring. I said, &ldquo;O Spring of water, have I
your good leave to ask what I should do
with this precious plant to put it to the
best use?&rdquo; The silver lining of the spring
made its words much easier to catch when
it said anything&mdash;for I should tell you that
for the most part now it did not speak, or
not in any language that I could understand,
but rather sang&mdash;and it now said,
&ldquo;<em>Swallow swallow, drink, swallow</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<em>Prompt</em> obedience, dear Jane, has always
been my motto, as it is doubtless yours,
and I at once laid myself down, drank a
mouthful of water from the spring, and put
the little bulb in my mouth. It instantly
grew soft and slipped down my throat.
How prosaic! I have no idea what it
tasted like.</p>

<p>And again I addressed the spring: &ldquo;Is
there anything more for me to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>No no, no no, you'll see, you'll see&mdash;good-bye,
good-bye</em>,&rdquo; was the answer which
came at once.</p>

<p>Accordingly I once more thanked the
spring, wished it clear water, no mud, no
tramplings of cattle, and bade it farewell.
But, I said, I should hope to visit it
again.</p>

<p>Then I turned away and looked about
me, wondering whether, now that I had
swallowed the mysterious plant, I should
see anything different. The only thing I
noticed was due, I suppose, not to the
plant, but to the spring; but it was odd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
enough. All the trees hard by were crowded
with little birds of all kinds sitting in rows
on the branches as they do on telegraph
wires. I have no doubt they were listening
to the silver bell in the spring. They were
quite still, and did not take any notice
when I began to walk away.</p>

<p>I said, you will remember, that the ground
I was on was a sort of flat terrace at the
top of a steep slope. Now at one end this
terrace just went down into the wood, but
at the other end there was a little mound
or hillock with thick underwood behind it.
I felt a curiosity, an inclination, to walk
that way: I have very little doubt that
the plant was at the bottom of it. As I
walked I looked at the ground, and noticed
a curious thing: the roots of the plants
and grasses seemed to show more than I
was accustomed to see them.</p>

<p>It was not a great way to the hillock.
When I got to it I wondered why I had
gone, for there was nothing odd about it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Still I stepped on to the top, and then I
did see something, namely, a square flat
stone just in front of my feet. I poked at
it with my walking-stick, but somehow I did
not seem to touch it, nor was there any
scraping noise. This was funny. I tried
again, and now I saw that my stick was not
touching it at all; there was something in
between. I felt with my hands, and they
met with what seemed like grass and earth,
certainly not like stone. <em>Then</em> I understood.
The plant was the one which makes you
able to see what is under the ground!</p>

<p>I need not tell you all I thought, or how
surprising and delightful it was. The first
thing was to get at the flat stone and find
out what was underneath it.</p>

<p>Accordingly, what with a knife and what
with my fingers, I soon had it uncovered:
it was four or five inches under the surface.
There were no marks on it; it measured
more than a foot each way. I lifted it. It
was the cover of a sort of box with bottom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and sides each made of a slab just like the
lid. In this box was another, made of some
dark metal, which I took to be lead. I
pulled it out and found that the lid of the
box was all of one piece with the rest, like
a sardine tin. Evidently I could not open
it there and then. It was rather heavy,
but I did not care, and I managed without
too much inconvenience to carry it home to
the place I was lodging in. Of course I put
back the stone neatly and covered it up
with earth and grass again.</p>

<p>I was late for tea, but I had found what
was better than tea.</p>



<div class="new-h2"></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<h2>II<br/> THE FIRST JAR</h2>


<p>That night I waited till the moon was
up before trying to open the box. I
do not well know why, but it seemed the
right thing, and I followed my instinct,
feeling that it might be the plant that
made me think as I did. I drew up the
blind and laid the box on a table near the
window, where the moon shone full on it,
and waited to see if anything else occurred
to me. Suddenly I heard a sort of metallic
snap. I went and looked at the box.
Nothing appeared on the side nearest to
me&mdash;but when I turned it round I saw that
all along the side which the moon had shone
upon there was a line along the metal. I
turned another side to the moonlight, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
another snap came in two or three minutes.
Of course I went on. When the moon had
made a groove on all four sides, I tried the
lid. It would not come off yet, so there
was nothing to be done but continue the
process. Three times I did it: every side I
turned to the moon thrice, and when that
was done the lid was free. I lifted it, and
what did I see in the box? All this writing
would be very little use if I did not tell you,
so it must be done.</p>

<p>There were five compartments in the box:
in each of them was a little jar or vase of
glass with a round body, a narrow neck, and
spreading out a little at the top. The top
of each was covered with a plate of metal
and on each plate was a word or two in
capital letters. On the one in the middle
there were the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unge oculos</i>, the other
jars had one word apiece, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aures</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linguam</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">frontem</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pectus</i>.</p>

<p>Now, years ago, I took great pains to
learn the Latin language, and on many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
occasions I have found it <em>most useful</em>, whatever
you may see to the contrary in the
newspaper: but seldom or never have I
found it more useful than now. I saw at
once that the words meant <em>anoint the eyes</em>,
<em>the ears</em>, <em>the tongue</em>, <em>the forehead</em>, <em>the chest</em>.
What would be the result of my doing this,
of course I knew no more than you: but I
was pretty sure that it would not do to try
them all at once, and another thing I felt,
that it would be better to wait till next day
before trying any of them. It was past
midnight now, so I went to bed: but first
I locked up the box in a cupboard, for I
did not want anyone to see it as yet.</p>

<hr/><div style="margin-top: 3em;"></div>

<p>Next day I woke bright and early, looked
at my watch, found there was no need to
think about getting up yet, and, like a wise
creature, went to sleep again. I mention
this, not merely by way of being jocose,
but because after I went to sleep I had
a dream which most likely came from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the plant and certainly had to do with
the box.</p>

<p>I seemed to see a room, or to be in a
room about which I only noticed that the
floor was paved with mosaic in a pattern
mostly red and white, that there were no
pictures on the walls and no fireplace, no
sashes or indeed panes in the window, and
the moon was shining in very bright. There
was a table and a chest. Then I saw an
old man, rather badly shaved and bald, in a
Roman dress, white for the most part, with
a purple stripe somewhere, and sandals. He
looked by no means a wicked or designing
old man. I was glad of that. He opened
the chest, took out my box, and placed it
carefully on the table in the moonlight.
Then he went to a part of the room I could
not see, and I heard a sound of water being
poured into a metal basin, and he came into
sight again, wiping his hands on a white
towel. He opened the box, took out a little
silver spoon and one of the jars, took off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the lid and dipped the spoon in the jar
and touched first his right eye and then his
left with it. Then he put the jar and the
spoon back, laid the lid on the box and put
it back in the chest. After that he went
to the window and stood there looking out,
and seemed to be very much amused with
what he saw. That was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hints for me,&rdquo; I remember thinking.
&ldquo;Perhaps it will be best not to touch the
box before the moon is up to-night, and
always with washed hands.&rdquo; I suppose I
woke up immediately, for it was all very
fresh in my mind when I did.</p>

<p>It was something of a disappointment to
have to put off my experiments till the night
came round. But it was all for the best,
for letters came by the post which I had to
attend to: in fact, I was obliged to go to
the town a little way off to see someone
and to send telegrams and so on. I was a
little doubtful about the seeing things underground,
but I soon found that unless I&mdash;so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to say&mdash;turned on the tap, and specially
wished and tried to use the power, it did not
interfere with my ordinary seeing. When I
did, it seemed to come forward from the
back of my eyes, and was stronger than
the day before. I could see rabbits in their
burrows and followed the roots of one oak-tree
very deep down. Once it threatened to
be awkward, when I stooped to pick up a
silver coin in the street, and grazed my
knuckle against a paving stone, under which,
of course, it was.</p>

<p>So much for that. By the way, I had
taken a look at the box after breakfast, I
found (not very much to my surprise) that
the lid was as tight on it as when I found
it first.</p>

<p>After dinner that evening I put out the
light&mdash;the moon being now bright&mdash;placed
the box on the table, washed my hands,
opened it and, shutting my eyes, put my
hand on one of the jars at random and
took it out. As I had rather expected, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
heard a little rattle as I did so, and feeling
in the compartment, I found a little, a very
little, spoon. All was well. Now to see
which jar chance or the plant had chosen
for my first experiment. I took it to the
window: it was the one marked <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aures</i>&mdash;ears&mdash;and
the spoon had on the handle a
letter A. I opened the jar. The lid fitted
close but not over tightly. I put in the
spoon as the old man had done, as near as
I could remember. It brought out a very
small drop of thick stuff with which I
touched first my right ear and then my left.
When I had done so I looked at the spoon.
It was perfectly dry. I put it and the jar
back, closed the box, locked it up, and, not
knowing in the least what to expect, went
to the open window and put my head out.</p>

<p>For some little time I heard nothing.
That was to be expected, and I was not in
the least inclined to distrust the jar. Then
I was rewarded; a bat flew by, and I, who
have not heard a bat even squeak these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
twenty years, now heard this one say in a
whistling angry tone, &ldquo;Would you, would
you, <em>I've</em> got you&mdash;no, drat, drat.&rdquo; It was
not a very exciting remark, but it was
enough to show me that a whole new world
(as the books say) was open to me.</p>

<p>This, of course, was only a beginning.
There were some plants and flowering shrubs
under the window, and though I could see
nothing, I began to hear voices&mdash;two voices&mdash;talking
among them. They sounded young:
of course they were anyhow very small, but
they seemed to belong to young creatures
of their kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, I say, what have you got there?
Do let's look; you might as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a pause&mdash;another voice: &ldquo;I believe
it's a bad one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Number one</i>: &ldquo;Taste it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Number two</i>, after another pause, with a
slight sound (very diminutive) of spitting:
&ldquo;Heugh! bad! I should rather think it
was. Maggot!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<i>Number one</i> (after laughing rather longer
than I thought kind): &ldquo;Look here&mdash;don't
chuck it away&mdash;let's give it to the old man.
Here&mdash;shove the piece in again and rub it
over&mdash;here he is!&rdquo; (Very demurely): &ldquo;O
sir, we've got such a nice-looking&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (<em>I
could not catch what it was</em>) &ldquo;here; we
thought you might perhaps like it, sir.
Would you, sir?&hellip; Oh no, thank you, sir,
we've had plenty, sir, but this was the
biggest we found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A third voice said something; it was a
deeper one and less easy to hear.</p>

<p><i>Number two</i>: &ldquo;Bitten, sir? Oh no, I
don't think so. Do you&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; (<em>a name
which I did not make out</em>).</p>

<p><i>Number one</i>: &ldquo;Why, how could it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Number three</i> again&mdash;angry, I thought.</p>

<p><i>Number two</i> (rather anxiously): &ldquo;But,
sir, really, sir, I don't much like them.&hellip;
Must I really, sir?&hellip; O <em>sir</em>, it's got a
maggot in it, and I believe they're poison.&rdquo;
(<em>Smack, smack, smack, smack.</em>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Two voices, very lamentable: &ldquo;O <em>sir</em>,
sir, please sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A considerable pause, and sniffing. Then
<i>Number two</i>, in a broken voice: &ldquo;You silly
fool, why did you go laughing like that right
under his snout? You might have known
he'd cog it.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Cog.&rdquo; I had not heard the
word since 1876.) &ldquo;There'll be an awful row
to-morrow. Look here, I shall go to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voices died away; I thought <i>Number
one</i> seemed to be apologizing.</p>

<p>That was all I heard <em>that</em> night. After
eleven o'clock things seemed to get very
still, and I began to feel just a little apprehensive
lest something of a less innocent
kind should come along. So I went to bed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2>III<br/> THE SECOND JAR</h2>


<p>Next day, I must say, was very amusing.
I spent the whole of it in the
fields just strolling about and sitting down,
as the fancy took me, listening to what
went on in the trees and hedges. I will not
write down yet the kind of thing I heard,
for it was only the beginning. I had not
yet found out the way of using the new
power to the very best advantage. I felt
the want of being able to put in a remark
or a question of my own every now and
then. But I was pretty sure that the jar
which had <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linguam</i> on it would manage
that.</p>

<p>Very nearly all the talking I heard was
done by the birds and animals&mdash;especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the birds; but perhaps half a dozen times,
as I sat under a tree or walked along the
road, I was aware of voices which sounded
exactly like those of people (some grown-up
and some children) passing by or coming
towards me and talking to each other as
they went along. Needless to say, there
was nothing to be <em>seen</em>: no movement of
the grass and no track on the dusty road,
even when I could tell exactly where the
people who owned the voices must be. It
interested me more than anything else to
guess what sort of creatures they were, and
I determined that the next jar I tried should
be the Eye one. Once, I must tell you, I
ventured to say &ldquo;Good afternoon&rdquo; when I
heard a couple of these voices within a
yard of me. I think the owners must nearly
have had a fit. They stopped dead: one
of them gave a sort of cry of surprise, and
then, I believe, they ran or flew away. I
felt a little breath of wind on my face, and
heard no more. It wasn't (as I know now)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that they couldn't see me: but they felt
much as you would if a tree or a cow were
to say &ldquo;Good afternoon&rdquo; to you.</p>

<p>When I was at supper that evening, the
cat came in, as she usually did, to see what
was going. I had always been accustomed
to think that cats talk when they mew,
dogs when they bark, and so on. It is not
so at all. Their talking is almost all done
(except when they are in a great state of
mind) in a tone which you cannot possibly
hear without help. Mewing is for the most
part only shouting without saying any words.
Purring is, as we often say, singing.</p>

<p>Well, this cat was an ordinary nice
creature, tabby, and in she came, and sat
watching me while I had soup. To all
appearance she was as innocent as a lamb&mdash;but
no matter for that. What she was
saying was something of this kind:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get on with it, do: shove it down, lap
it up! Who cares about soup? Get to
business. I know there's fish coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
When the fish actually came, there was
a great deal of good feeling shown at first.
&ldquo;Oh, <em>how</em> much we have to be thankful for,
all of us, have we not? Fish, fish: what
a thought! Dear, kind, generous people all
around us, all striving to supply us with
what is best and pleasantest for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then there was a silence for a short time,
then in a somewhat different tone I heard:
&ldquo;Ah dear! the longer I live, the wiser I
find it is not to expect too much consideration
from others! Self-love! how few, how
terribly few, are really free from it! The
nature that knows how to take a hint, how
rare it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another short silence, and then: &ldquo;There
you go&mdash;another great bit. I wonder you
don't choke or burst! Disgusting! A good
scratch all down your horrible fat cheek is
what you want, and I know some cats that
would give it you. No more notion how to
behave than a cockroach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About this time I rang the bell and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
fish was taken away. The cat went too,
circling round the maid with trusting and
childlike glances, and I heard her saying in
the former tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I daresay after all there are <em>some</em>
kind hearts in the world, some that can
feel for a poor weary creature, and know
what a deal of strength and nourishment
even the least bit of fish can give&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
And I lost the rest.</p>

<p>When the time came and the box was
open once more, I duly anointed my eyes
and went to the window. I knew something
of what I might expect to see, but I
had not realized at all how much of it there
would be. In the first place there were a
great many buildings, in fact a regular
village, all about the little lawn on which
my window looked. They were, of course,
not big; perhaps three feet high was the
largest size. The roofs seemed to be of
tiles, the walls were white, the windows
were brightly lighted, and I could see people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
moving about inside. But there were plenty
of people outside, too&mdash;people about six
inches high&mdash;walking about, standing about,
talking, running, playing some game which
might have been hockey. These were on
levelled spaces, for the grass, neatly kept as
it was, would have come half-way up their
legs; and there were some driving along
smooth tracks in carriages drawn by horses
of the right size, which were really the most
charming little animals I ever saw.</p>

<p>You may suppose that I should not soon
have got tired of watching them and listening
to the little treble buzz of voices that
went on, but I was interrupted. Just in
front of me I heard what I can only call a
snigger. I looked down, and saw four heads
supported by four pairs of elbows leaning
on the window-sill and looking up at me.
They belonged to four boys who were standing
on the twigs of a bush that grew up
against the wall, and who seemed to be very
much amused. Every now and again one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of them nudged another and pointed towards
me; and then, for some unexplained reason,
they sniggered again. I felt my ears growing
warm and red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, young gentlemen,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you
seem to be enjoying yourselves.&rdquo; No
answer. &ldquo;I appear to be so fortunate as
to afford you some gratification,&rdquo; I went
on, in my sarcastic manner. &ldquo;Perhaps you
would do me the honour of stepping into
my poor apartment?&rdquo; Again no answer,
but more undisguised amusement. I was
thinking out a really withering remark,
when one of them said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do look at his nose. I wonder if they
know how ridiculous they are. I <em>should</em> like
to talk to one of them for five minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that can be managed
very easily, and I assure you I should be
equally glad of the opportunity. <em>My</em> remarks
would deal with the subject of good
manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another one spoke this time, but did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
answer me. &ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I expect they're pretty stupid. They look
it&mdash;at least this one does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can they talk?&rdquo; said the third. &ldquo;I've
never heard 'em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but you can see them moving their
jaws and mouths and things. This one did
just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw how it was now, and, becoming
cooler, I recognized that these youths were
behaving very much as I might have done
myself in the presence of someone who I
was sure could neither see nor hear me. I
even smiled. One of them pointed at me
at once:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought of a joke, I s'pose. Don't
keep it all to yourself, old chap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment the fourth, who had not
said anything so far, but seemed to have
been listening, piped up: &ldquo;I say! I believe
I know what it is that makes that hammering
noise: it's something he has got in his
clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
I could not resist this. &ldquo;Right again,&rdquo;
I said; &ldquo;it's my watch, and you're very
welcome to look at it.&rdquo; And I took it out
and put it on the window-sill.</p>

<p>An awful horror and surprise came into
their faces. In a second they had dived
down like so many ducks. In another
second I saw them walking across the
grass, and each of them threw his arms
round the waist or the neck of one of the
elder people who were walking about among
the houses. The person so attacked pulled
himself up and listened attentively to what
the boy was saying. The particular one I
was watching looked towards my window
and then burst out laughing, slapped the
boy on the back, and resumed his walk.
The boy went slowly off towards one of the
houses. One or two of the other &ldquo;men&rdquo;
came and stood nearer to the window, looking
up. I thought I would venture a bow,
and made one rather ceremoniously. It did
not produce much effect, and I could not at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the moment think of anything I could do
that would show them quite clearly that I
saw them. They went on looking at me
quietly enough, and then I heard a deep
low bell, seemingly very far off, toll five
times. They heard it too, turned sharply
round and walked off to the houses. Soon
after that the lights in the windows died
down and everything became very still. I
looked at my watch. It was ten o'clock.</p>

<p>I waited for a while to see if anything
would happen, but there was nothing; so
I got some books out (which took a few
minutes) and before I settled down to them
I thought I would just take one more look
out of the window. Where were all the
little houses? At the first glance I thought
they had vanished, but it was not exactly
so. I found I could still see the chimneys
above the grass, but as I looked they
too disappeared. It was done very neatly:
there was no hole, the turf closed in upon
the roofs as they sank down, just as if it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
was of india-rubber. There was not a trace
left of houses or roads or playgrounds or
anything.</p>

<p>I was strongly tempted to go out and
walk over the site of the village, but I did
not. For one thing I was afraid I might
disturb the people of the house, and besides
there was a mist coming up over the meadows
which sloped away outside the garden. So
I stopped where I was.</p>

<p>But what a very odd mist, I began to
think. It was not coming in all in one piece
as it should. It was more in patches or
even pillars of a smoky grey which moved
at different rates, some of them occasionally
standing still, others even seeming to go to
and fro. And now I began to hear something
like a hollow whispering coming from
their direction. It was not conversation,
for it went on quite continuously in the
same tone: it sounded more as if something
was being recited. I did not like it.</p>

<p>Then I saw what I liked less. Seven of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
these pillars of mist, each about the size of
a man, were standing in a row just outside
the garden fence, and in each I thought I
saw two dull red eyes; and the hollow whispering
grew louder.</p>

<p>Just then I heard a noise behind me in
the room, as if the fire-irons had suddenly
fallen down. So they had: and the reason
why they had was that an old horseshoe
which was on the mantelpiece had, for
no reason that I could see, tumbled over
and knocked them. Something I had heard
came into my mind. I took the horseshoe
and laid it on the window-sill. The pillars
of mist swayed and quivered as if a sudden
gust of wind had struck them, and seemed
all at once to go farther off; and the hollow
murmur was no longer to be heard. I shut
the window and went to bed. But, the
last thing, I looked out once again. The
meadow was clear of mist and bright beneath
the light of the moon.</p>

<p>As I lay in bed I thought and thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
over what I had seen last. I was quite sure
that the pillars of mist concealed some beings
who wished me no good: but why should
they have any spite against me? I was also
sure that they wanted to get into the house:
but again, why? You may think I was slow
in the wits, but I must confess that some
few minutes passed before I guessed. Of
course they wanted to get hold of the box
with the five jars. The thought disturbed
me so much that I got up, lighted a candle,
and went to the cupboard to see if all was
safe. Yes, the box was there, but the cupboard
door, which I knew I had locked, was
unfastened, and when I had to turn the key
it became plain that the lock was hampered
and useless. How could this have come
about? Earlier in the evening it had been
perfectly right, and nobody had been in the
room since I locked it last.</p>

<p>Whoever had done it, they had made the
cupboard no safe place for the box. I took
it into the bedroom and after a minute's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
thought cleared out a space in a suit-case
which I had brought with me, locked it in
that, and put the key on the ring of my
watch-chain. Watch and all went under
my pillow, and once more I got into bed.</p>



<div class="new-h2"></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<h2>IV<br/> THE SMALL PEOPLE</h2>


<p>You will have made sure that the next
jar I meant to try was the one for the
tongue, in hopes that it would help me to
speak to some of the creatures. Though
I looked forward to the experiment very
much, and felt somewhat restless until I
had made it, I did get a good deal of
amusement out of what I saw and heard
the next day. The small people were not
to be seen&mdash;at least not in the morning.
No, I am wrong: I found a bunch of three
of them&mdash;young ones&mdash;asleep in a hollow
tree. They woke up and looked at me
without much interest, and when I was
withdrawing my head they blew kisses to
me. I am afraid there is no doubt they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
did so in derision. But there were others.
I passed a cottage garden in which a little
dog was barking most furiously. It seemed
to be barking at a clothes-line, on which,
with a lot of other things, was a print dress
with rather a staring pattern of flowers.
The dress caught my eye, and so did something
red at the top which stuck up above
the line. I gave it another glance, and
really I had a most dreadful shock. It was
a face. I gazed at it in horror, and was
just gathering my wits to run and call for
help or something, when I saw that it was
laughing. Then I realized that it could not
be an ordinary person, hanging as it was
on a thin bit of cord and blowing to and
fro in the breeze. I went nearer, staring at
it with all my eyes, and made out that it
was the face of an old woman, very cheerful
and ruddy, and, as I said, laughing and
swinging to and fro. Suddenly she seemed
to catch my eye and to see that I saw her,
and in a flash she was off the line and round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the corner of the house, nearly tumbling
over the dog as she went. It rushed after
her, still very angry, but soon came trotting
back, rather out of breath, and <em>that</em> incident
was over.</p>

<p>I walked on. Among the village people I
met, there were one or two whom I didn't
think I had seen before&mdash;elderly, bright-eyed
people they were&mdash;who seemed very
much surprised when I said &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo;
to them, and stopped still, looking after
me, when I passed on. At last, some little
way outside the village, I saw in the distance
the same bright-coloured dress that
had been on the clothes-line. The person
who wore it was going slowly, and looking
in the grass and hedges, and sometimes
stooping to pick a plant, as it seemed. I
quickened my pace and came up with her,
and when I was just behind her, I cleared
my throat rather loudly and said, &ldquo;Fine
day,&rdquo; or words to that effect.</p>

<p>You should have seen her jump! I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
well paid for the fright she had given me
just before. However, the startled look
cleared away from her face, and she drew
herself up and looked at me very calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it's a fine day.&rdquo; Then
she actually blushed and went on: &ldquo;I
think I ought to beg your pardon for giving
you such a turn just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I certainly was a good
deal startled, but no harm was done. The
dog took it more to heart than I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave a short laugh. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I hardly know why I was behaving
like that. I suppose we all of us feel skittish
at times.&rdquo; She paused and said with
some little hesitation, &ldquo;You have them,
I suppose?&rdquo; and at the same time she
rapidly touched her ears, eyes and mouth
with her forefinger.</p>

<p>I looked at her in some doubt, for I
thought, might not she be one of the unknown
who wished to get hold of the Five
Jars? But her eye was honest, and my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
instinct was to trust her: so I nodded, and
put my finger on my lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well, you are
the first since I was a little thing, and
that's fourteen hundred years ago.&rdquo; (You
may think I opened my eyes.) &ldquo;Yes,
Vitalis was the last, and he lived in the
villa&mdash;they called it so&mdash;down by the
stream. You'll find the place some of
these days if you look. I heard talk
yesterday that someone had got them, and
I'm told the mist was about last night.
Perhaps you saw it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I did, and I guessed
what it meant.&rdquo; And I told her all that
had happened, and ended by asking if she
could kindly advise me what to do.</p>

<p>She thought for a moment, and then
handed me a little bunch of the leaves she
held in her hand. &ldquo;Four-leaved clover,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I know nothing better. Lay
it on the box itself. You'll hear of them
again, be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who are <em>they</em>?&rdquo; I asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &ldquo;Not allowed,&rdquo;
was all she would say. &ldquo;I must be going&rdquo;;
and she was gone, sure enough. You might
suppose (as I did, when I came to think of
it) that my new sight ought to have been
able to see what became of her. I think it
would, if she had gone straight away from
me; but what I believe she did was to dart
round behind me and then go away in a
straight line, so that I was left looking in
front of me while she was travelling away
behind me like a bullet from a gun. You
need practice with these things, and I had
only been at it a couple of days.</p>

<p>I turned and walked rather quickly homewards,
for I thought it would be wise to
protect my box as soon as possible now
that I had the means. I think it was
fortunate that I did.</p>

<p>As I opened the garden gate I saw an
old woman coming down the path&mdash;an old
woman very unlike the last. &ldquo;Old&rdquo; was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the word for her face: she might have been
born before the history-books begin. As to
her expression, if ever you saw a snake
with red rims to its eyes and the expression
of a parrot, you might have some idea of
it. She was hobbling along with a stick, in
quite the proper manner, but I felt certain
that all that was put on, and that she
could have glided as swift as an adder if
she pleased. I confess I was afraid of her.
I had a feeling that she knew everything
and hated everybody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what,&rdquo; I suddenly thought, &ldquo;has
she been up to? If she has got at the
box, where am I? and more than that,
what mischief will she and her company
work among the small people and the birds
and beasts?&rdquo; There would be no mercy
for them; a glance at her eye told me that.</p>

<p>It was an immense relief to see that
she could not possibly have got the box
about her, and another relief when my eye
travelled to the door of the house and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
saw no fewer than three horseshoes nailed
above it. I smiled to myself. Oh, how
angry she looked! But she had to act her
part, and with feeble curtseys and in a very
small hoarse trembling voice she wished me
a good day (though I noticed her pointing
to the ground with her thumb as she said
the words) and would be very obliged if I
could tell her the right time. I was going
to pull out my watch (and if I had, she
would have seen a certain key we know of),
when something said suddenly and clearly
to my brain, &ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; and by good luck
I heard a clock inside the house strike one
before I could answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just struck one,&rdquo; was my reply accordingly,
and I said it as innocently as I could.
She drew her breath in hard and quivered
all over, and her mouth remained open like
a cat's when it is using its worst expressions,
and when she eventually thanked me
I leave it to you to imagine how gracefully
she did it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Well, she had no more cards to play at
the moment, and no excuse for remaining.
I stood my ground and watched her out of
the gate. A path led down the meadow,
and, much against her will no doubt, she
had to keep up the pretence and toil painfully
along it until she reached another
hedge and could reckon on being out of my
sight. After that I neither saw nor expected
to see anything more of her. I went up to
my room and found all safe, and laid the
four-leaved clover on the box. At luncheon
I took occasion to find out from the maid,
without asking her in so many words,
whether the old woman had been visible to
her; evidently she had not: evidently also,
the evil creatures were really on the track
of the Five Jars, knew that I had them,
and had a very fair idea of where they
were kept.</p>

<p>However, if the maid had not seen her,
the cat had, and murmured a good deal to
herself, and was in a rather nervous state.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
She sat, with her ears turned different
ways, on the window-sill, looking out, and
twitching her back uncomfortably, like an
old lady who feels a draught. When I was
available, she came and sat on my knee
(a very uncommon attention on her part)
with an air half of wishing to be protected
and half of undertaking to protect me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there is fish to-night,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you
shall have some.&rdquo; But I was not yet in a
position to make myself understood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pussy's been sleepin' on your box all
the afternoon, sir,&rdquo; said the maid when I
came in to tea. &ldquo;I couldn't get her to
come off; and when I did turn her out of
the room, I do believe she climbed up and
got in again by the winder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't mind at all,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;let her
be there if she likes.&rdquo; And indeed I felt
quite grateful to the cat. I don't know
that she could have done much if there had
been any attempt on the box, but I was
sure her intentions were good.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
There was fish that evening, and she had
a good deal of it. She did not say much
that I could follow, but chiefly sang songs
without words.</p>

<p class="hr">* * * * *</p>

<p>Not to go over the preliminaries again, I
did, when the proper time came, touch my
tongue with the contents of the third jar. I
found that it worked in this way: I could
not hear what I was saying myself, when I
was talking to an animal: I only <em>thought</em>
the remark very clearly, and then I felt my
tongue and lips moving in an odd fashion,
which I can't describe. But with the small
people in human shape it was different. I
spoke in the ordinary way to them, and
though I dare say my voice went up an
octave or two, I can't say I perceived it.</p>

<p>The village was there again to-night, and
the life going on in it seemed much the
same. I was set upon making acquaintance
in a natural sort of way with the people,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and as it would not do to run any risk of
startling them, I just took my place near
the window and made some pretence of
playing Patience. I thought it likely that
some of the young people would come and
watch me, in spite of the fright they had
had the night before. And it was not long
before I heard a rustling in the shrubs under
the window and voices saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he in there? Can you see? Oh, I
say, <em>do</em> look out: you all but had me over
that time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were suddenly quiet after this, and
apparently one must have, very cautiously,
climbed up and looked into the room.
When he got down again there was a great
fuss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, is he really?&rdquo; &ldquo;What d'you say
he was doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;What sort of charm?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I say, d'you think we'd better get
down?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, but what is he really
doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;Laying out rows of flat things
on the table, with marks on them.&rdquo; &ldquo;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
don't believe it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, you go and look
yourself.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right, I shall.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, but,
I say, do look out: suppose you get shut in
and we're late for the bell?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, you
fool, I shan't go into the room, only stop
on the window-sill.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I don't know,
but I do believe he saw us last night, and
my father said he thought so too.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,
well, he can't move very quick, anyway,
and he's some way off the window. <em>I</em> shall
go up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I managed, without altering my position
too much, to keep my eye on the window-sill,
and, sure enough, in a second or two a
small round head came into sight. I went
on with my game. At first I could see that
the watcher was ready to duck down at
the slightest provocation, but as I took no
sort of notice, he gained confidence, leant
his elbows on the sill, and then actually
pulled himself up and sat down on it. He
bent over and whispered to the others
below, and it was not long before I saw a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
whole row of heads filling up the window-sill
from end to end. There must have
been a dozen of them. I thought the time
was come, and without moving, and in as
careless a tone as I could, I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, gentlemen, come in; don't be
shy.&rdquo; There was a rustle, and two or three
heads disappeared, but nobody said anything.
&ldquo;Come in, if you like,&rdquo; I said again;
&ldquo;you can hear the bell quite well from here,
and I shan't shut the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise!&rdquo; said the one who was sitting
on the sill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise, honour bright,&rdquo; I said, whereupon
he made the plunge. First he dropped
on to the seat of a chair by the window,
and from that to the floor. Then
he wandered about the room, keeping at
a distance from me at first, and, I have
no doubt, watching very anxiously to see
whether I had any intention of pouncing on
him. The others followed, first one by one
and then two or three at a time. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
remained sitting on the window-sill, but
most plucked up courage to get down on to
the floor and explore.</p>

<p>I had now my first good chance of seeing
what they were like. They all wore the
same fashion of clothes&mdash;a tunic and close-fitting
hose and flat caps&mdash;seemingly very
much what a boy would have worn in
Queen Elizabeth's time. The colours were
sober&mdash;dark blue, dark red, grey, brown&mdash;and
each one's clothes were of one colour
all through. They had some white linen
underneath; it showed a little at the neck.
There were both fair and dark among them:
all were clean and passably good-looking,
one or two certainly handsome. The firstcomer
was ruddy and auburn-haired and
evidently a leader. They called him Wag.</p>

<p>I heard whispers from corners of the
room, and appeals to Wag to explain what
this and that unfamiliar object was, and
noticed that he was never at a loss for an
answer of some kind, correct or not. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
fireplace, which had its summer dressing,
was, it appeared, a rock garden; an old
letter lying on the floor was a charm (&ldquo;Better
not touch it&rdquo;); the waste-paper basket (not
unnaturally) a prison; the pattern on the
carpet was&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, you wouldn't understand
it if I was to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon a voice&mdash;Wag's voice&mdash;came from
somewhere near my foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, could I get up on the top?&rdquo; I
offered to lift him, but he declined rather
hastily and said my leg would be all right if
I didn't mind putting it out a bit sloping:
and he then ran up it on all fours&mdash;he
was quite a perceptible weight&mdash;and got on
to the table from my knee without any
difficulty.</p>

<p>Once there, there was a great deal to
interest him&mdash;books, papers, ink, pens,
pipes, matches and cards. He was full of
questions about them, and his being so
much at his ease encouraged the others to
follow him, so that before very long the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
whole lot were perambulating the table and
making me very nervous lest they should
fall off, while Wag was standing close up
to me and putting me through a catechism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you have such <em>little</em> spears
for?&rdquo; he wanted to know, brandishing a
pen at me. &ldquo;Is that blood on the end?
whose blood? Well then, what do you do
with it? Let's see&mdash;only that?&rdquo; (when I
wrote a word or two). &ldquo;Well, you can tell
me about it another time. Now I want to
know what these clubs in the chest are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said, &ldquo;We make fire with them; if you
like I'll show you&mdash;but it makes a little
noise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Wag; and I struck a
match, rather expecting a stampede. But
no, they were quite unmoved, and Wag
said, &ldquo;Beastly row and smell&mdash;why don't
you do the ordinary way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He brushed the palm of his left hand
along the tips of the fingers on his right
hand, put them to his lips and then to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
eyes, and behold! his eyes began to glow
from behind with a light which would have
been quite bright enough for him to read
by. &ldquo;Quite simple,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;don't you
know it?&rdquo; Then he did the same thing in
reverse order, touching eyes, lips and hand,
and the light was gone. I didn't like to
confess that this was beyond me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that's all very well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but
how do you manage about your houses? I
am sure I saw lights in the windows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;put as many as you
want;&rdquo; and he ran round the table dabbing
his hand here and there on the cloth, or on
anything that lay on it, and at every place
a little round bud or drop of very bright
but also soft light came out. &ldquo;See?&rdquo; he
said, and darted round again, passing his
hands over the lights and touching his lips;
and they were gone. He came back and
said, &ldquo;It's a <em>much</em> better way; it is <em>really</em>,&rdquo;
as if it were only my native stupidity that
prevented me from using it myself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
A smaller one, who looked to me rather a
quieter sort than Wag, had come up and
was standing by him: he now said in a
low voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;P'raps they can't.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed a new idea to Wag: he made
his eyes very round. &ldquo;Can't? Oh, rot!
it's quite simple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other shook his head and pointed to
my hand which rested on the table. Wag
looked at it too, and then at my face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could I see it spread out?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you'll promise not to spoil it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed slightly, and then both he and
the other&mdash;whom he called Slim&mdash;bent
over and looked closely at the tips of my
fingers. &ldquo;Other side, please,&rdquo; he said after
a time, and they subjected my nails to a
like examination. The others, who had been
at the remoter parts of the table, wandered
up and looked over their shoulders. After
tapping my nails and lifting up one or more
fingers, Wag stood upright and said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, I s'pose it's true, and you can't.
I thought your sort could do anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought much the same about you,&rdquo;
I said in self-defence. &ldquo;I always thought
you could fly, but you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we can,&rdquo; said Wag very sharply, and
his face grew red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;then why haven't you
been doing it to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kicked one foot with the other and
looked quickly at Slim. The rest said nothing
and edged away, humming to themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we <em>can</em> fly perfectly well, only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only not to-night, I suppose,&rdquo; said I,
rather unkindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, <em>not</em> to-night,&rdquo; said Wag; &ldquo;and you
needn't laugh, either&mdash;we'll soon show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That <em>will</em> be nice,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and when
will you show me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let's see&rdquo; (he turned to Slim), &ldquo;two
nights more, isn't it? All right then (to
me), in two nights more you'll see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Just then a moth which flew in caused
a welcome diversion&mdash;for I could see that
somehow I had touched on a sore subject,
and that he was feeling awkward&mdash;and he
first jumped at it and then ran after it.
Slim lingered. I raised my eyebrows and
pointed at Wag. Slim nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; he said in a low voice,
&ldquo;he got us into rather a row yesterday
and we're all stopped flying for three
nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I <em>see</em>: you must tell him
I am very sorry for being so stupid. May
I ask who stopped you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just the old man, not the owls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do go to the owls for something,
then?&rdquo; I asked, trying to appear
intelligent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, history and geography.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;of course they've
seen a lot, haven't they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they say,&rdquo; said Slim, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the low toll of the bell was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
wafted through the window and there was
an instant scurry to the edge of the table,
then to the seat of the chair, and up to
the window-sill; small arms waved caps at
me, the shrubs rustled, and I was left alone.</p>



<div class="new-h2"></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<h2>V<br/> DANGER TO THE JARS</h2>


<p>Now my ears and eyes and tongue had
been dealt with, and what remained
were the forehead and the chest. I could
not guess what would come of treating these
with the ointment, but I thought I would
try the forehead first. There was still a
day or two when the moon would be bright
enough for the trial. I hoped that perhaps
the effect of these two last jars might be
to make me able to go on with my experiences&mdash;to
keep in touch with the new people
I had come across&mdash;during the time when
she&mdash;the moon, I mean&mdash;was out of sight.</p>

<p>I had one anxiety. The precious box
must be guarded from those who were after
it. About this I had a conviction, that if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
I could keep them off until I had used
each of the five jars, the box and I would
be safe. Why I felt sure of this I could
not say, but my experience had led me to
trust these beliefs that came into my head,
and I meant to trust this one. It would
be best, I thought, if I did not go far from
the house&mdash;perhaps even if I did not leave
it at all till the time of danger was past.</p>

<p>Several things happened in the course of
the morning which confirmed me in my
belief. I took up a position at the table by
the window of my sitting-room. I had put
the box in my suit-case, which I had locked,
and I now laid it beside me where I could
keep an eye upon it. The view from my
window showed me, first, the garden of the
cottage, with its lawn and little flower beds,
its hedge and back gate, and beyond that
a path leading down across a field. More
fields, I knew, came after that one, and
sloped pretty sharply down to a stream in
the valley, which I could not see; but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
could see the steep slope of fields, partly
pasture, and then clothed with green woods
towards the top. There were no other
houses in sight: the road was behind me,
passing the front of the cottage, and my
bedroom looked out that way. I had some
writing and reading to do, and I had not
long finished breakfast before I settled down
to it, and heard the maid &ldquo;doing out&rdquo; the
bedroom as usual, accompanied every now
and then by a slight mew from the cat, who
(also as usual) was watching her at work.
These mews meant nothing in particular,
I may say; they were only intended to
be met by an encouraging remark, such as
&ldquo;There you are, then, pussy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don't
get in my way, now,&rdquo; or &ldquo;All in good time.&rdquo;
Finally I heard &ldquo;Come along then, and let's
see what we've got for you downstairs,&rdquo;
and the door was shut. I mention this
because of what happened about a quarter
of an hour later.</p>

<p>There was suddenly a fearful crash in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
bedroom, a fall, a breaking of glass and
crockery and snapping of wood, and then,
fainter, sobbings and moans of pain. I
started up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;she must have
been dusting that heavy shelf high up on
the wall with all the china on it, and the
whole thing has given way. She must be
badly hurt! But why doesn't her mistress
come rushing upstairs? and what was that
rasping noise just beside me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked at my suit-case, which lay on
the table just inside the open window.
Across the new smooth top of it there were
three deep scratches running towards the
window, which had not been there before.
I moved it to the other side of me and sat
down. There had been an attempt to decoy
me out of the room, and it had failed.
Certainly there would be more.</p>

<p>I waited; but everything was quiet in
the house: no more noise from the bedroom
and no one moving about, upstairs or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
downstairs; nothing but the pump clanking
in the scullery. I turned to my work again.</p>

<p>Half an hour must have gone by, and,
though on the look-out, I was not fidgety.
Then I was aware of a confused noise from
the field outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! help! Keep off, you brute! Help,
you there!&rdquo; as well as I could make out,
again and again. Towards the far end of
the field, which was a pretty large one, a
poor old man was trying to get to a gate
in the hedge at a staggering run, and striking
now and then with his stick at a great
deer-hound which was leaping up at him
with hollow barks. It seemed as if nothing
but the promptest dash to the spot could
save him; it seemed, too, as if he had
caught sight of me at the window, for he
beckoned. How strange the cries sounded!
It was as if someone was shouting into an
empty jug. My field-glasses were by me on
the table, and I thought I would take just
<em>one</em> look before I rushed out. I am glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
I did; for, do you know, when I had the
glasses focused on the dog and the man,
all that I could see was a sort of fuzz of
dancing vapour, much as if the shimmering
air that you see on the heath on a hot day
had been gathered up and rolled into a
shape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; I said, as I put down the
glasses; and something in the air, about
four yards off, made a sharp hissing sound.
No doubt there were words, but I could
not distinguish them. A second attempt
had failed; you may be sure I was well on
the alert for the next.</p>

<p>I put away my books now, and sat looking
out of the window, and wondering as I
watched whether there was anything out of
the common to be noticed. For one thing,
I thought there were more little birds about
than I expected. At first I did not see
them, for they were not hopping about on
the lawn; but as I stared at the hedge of
the garden, and at that of the field, I became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
aware that these were full of life. On
almost every twig that could hold a bird
in shelter&mdash;not on the top of the hedges&mdash;a
bird was sitting, quite still, and they were
all looking towards the window, as if they
were expecting something to happen there.
Occasionally one would flutter its wings a
little and turn its head towards its neighbour;
but this was all they did.</p>

<p>I picked up my glasses and began to
study the bottom of the hedges and the
bushes, where there was some quantity of
dead leaves, and here, too, I could see that
there were spectators. A small bright eye
or a bit of a nose was visible almost wherever
I looked; in short, the mice, and, I
don't doubt, some of the rats, hedgehogs,
and toads as well, were collected there and
were as intently on the watch as the birds.
&ldquo;What a chance for the cat, if only she
knew!&rdquo; I put my head cautiously out of
the window, and looking down on the sill
of the window below, I could see her head,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
with the ears pushed forward; she was
looking earnestly at the hedge, but she did
not move. Only, at the slight noise I made,
she turned her face upwards and crowed to
me in a modest but encouraging manner.</p>

<p>Time passed on. Luncheon was laid&mdash;on
another table&mdash;and was over, before anything
else happened.</p>

<p>The next thing was that I heard the maid
saying sharply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What business 'ave you got going round
to the back? We don't want none of your
rubbish here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hoarse voice answered inaudibly.</p>

<p><i>Maid</i>: &ldquo;No, nor the gentleman don't
want none of your stuff neither; and how
do you know there's a gentleman here at
all I should like to know? What? Don't
mean no offence? I dare say. That's more
than I know. Well, that's the last word
I've got to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a minute more there was a knock at
my door, and at the same time a step on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the gravel path under my window, and a
loud hiss from the cat. As I said &ldquo;Come
in&rdquo; to the knock, I hastily looked out of
the window, but saw nothing. It was the
maid who had knocked. She had come to
ask if there was anything I should like from
the village, or anything I should want
before tea-time, because the mistress was
going out, and wanted her to go over and
fetch something from the shop. I said there
was nothing except the letters and perhaps a
small parcel from the post office. She lingered
a moment before going, and finally said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You'll excuse me naming it, sir, but
there seems to be some funny people about
the roads to-day, if you'd please to be
what I mean to say a bit on the look-out,
if you're not a-going out yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;No, I don't mean
to go out. By the way, who was it came
to the door just now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was one of these 'awking men,
not one I've seen before, and he must be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
stranger in this part, I think, because he
began going round to the garden door, only
I stopped him. He'd got these cheap rubbishing
'atpins and what not; leastways,
if you understand me, what I thought to
myself I shouldn't like to be seen with 'em,
whatever others might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I see,&rdquo; I answered; and she went,
and I turned to my books once more.</p>

<p>Within a very few minutes I began to suspect
that I was getting sleepy. Yes, it was
undoubtedly so. What with the warmth of
the day, and lunch, and not having been
out.&hellip; There was a curious smell in the
room, too, not exactly nasty, like something
burning. What did it remind me of?
Wood smoke from a cottage fire, that one
smells on an autumn evening as one comes
bicycling down the hill into a village? Not
quite so nice as that; something more like
a chemist's shop. I wondered: and as I
wondered, my eyes closed and my head went
forward.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
A sharp pain on the back of my hand,
and a crash of glass! Up I jumped, and
which of three or four things I realized
first I don't know now. But I did realize
in a second or two that my hand was
bleeding from a scratch all down the back
of it, that a pane of the window was broken
and that the whole window was darkened
with little birds that were bumping their
chests against it; that the cat was on the
table gazing into my face with intense
expression, that a little smoke was drifting
into the room, and that my suit-case was on
the point of slipping out over the window-sill.
A despairing dash at it I made, and
managed to clutch it; but for the life of me
I could not pull it back. I could see no
string or cord, much less any hand that
was dragging at it. I hardly dared to take
my hand from it to catch up something
and hack at the thief I could not see.
Besides, there was nothing within reach.</p>

<p>Then I remembered the knife in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
pocket. Could I get it out and open it
without losing hold? &ldquo;They hate steel,&rdquo; I
thought. Somehow&mdash;frantically holding on
with one hand&mdash;I got out the knife, and
opened it, goodness knows how, for it was
horribly small and stiff, with my teeth, and
sheared and stabbed indiscriminately all
round the farther end of the suit-case.
Thank goodness, the strain relaxed. I got
the thing inside the window, dropped it,
and stood on it, craning over the garden
path and round the corner of the house.
Of course there was nothing to be seen.
The birds were gone. The cat was still
on the table saying &ldquo;O you owl! O you
owl!&rdquo; The sole and only clue to what
had been happening was a small earthenware
saucer that lay on the path immediately
below the window, with a little heap
of ashes in it, from which a thin column of
smoke was coming straight up and curling
over when it reached the window level.
That, I could not doubt, was the cause of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
my sudden sleepiness. I dropped a large
book straight on to it, and had the satisfaction
of hearing it crush to bits and of
seeing the smoke go four ways along the
ground and vanish.</p>

<p>I was perfectly awake now. I looked at
the cat, and showed her the back of my
hand. She sat quite still and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what did you expect? I had to
do something. I'll lick it if you like, but
I'd rather not. No particular ill-feeling, you
understand; all the same a hundred years
hence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not in a position to answer her,
so I shook my head at her, wound up my
hand in a handkerchief, and then stroked
her. She took it agreeably, jumped off the
table, and requested to be let out.</p>

<p>So the third attack had failed. I sat
down and looked out. The hedges were
empty; not a bird, not a mouse was left.
I took this to mean that the dangerous
time was past, and great was the relief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Soon I heard the maid come back from her
errands in the village, then the mistress's
chaise, then the clock striking five. I felt
it would be all right for me to go out
after tea.</p>

<p>And so I did; first, however, concealing
the suit-case in my bedroom&mdash;not that I
supposed hiding it would be of much use&mdash;and
piling upon it poker, tongs, knife, horseshoe,
and anything else I could find which
I thought would keep off trespassers. I
had, by the way, to explain to the maid
that a bird had flown against the window
and broken it, and when she said &ldquo;Stupid,
tiresome little things they are,&rdquo; I am afraid
I did not contradict her.</p>

<p>I went out by way of the garden and
crossed the field, near the middle of which
stands a large old oak. I went up to this,
for no particular reason, and stood gazing at
the trunk. As I did so I became aware that
my eyes were beginning to &ldquo;see through,&rdquo;
and behold! a family of owls was inside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
As it was near evening, they were getting
wakeful, stirring, smacking their beaks and
opening their wings a little from time to
time. At last one of them said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time's nearly up. Out and about! Out
and about!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyone outside?&rdquo; said another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No harm there,&rdquo; said the first.</p>

<p>This short way of talking, I believe, was
due to the owls not being properly awake
and consequently sulky. As they brightened
up and got their eyes open, they
began to be more easy in manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oop! Oop! Oop! I've had a very
good day of it. You have, too, I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sound as a rock, I thank you, except
when they were carrying on at the cottage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh goodness! I forgot! They didn't
bring it off, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not they; the watch was too well set,
but it was wanted. I had a leaf about it
a few minutes after, and it seems they got
him asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well! I never heard anyone bring a
leaf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say not, but I was expecting it;
pigeon dropped it. There it is, on that
child's back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw the hen-owl stoop and examine a
dead chestnut leaf which lay, as the other
had said, on an owlet's back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fa-a-ther!&rdquo; said this owlet suddenly,
in a shrill voice, &ldquo;mayn't I go out to-night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But all that Father did was to clasp its
head in his claw and push it to and fro
several times. When he let go, the owlet
made no sound, but crept away and hid its
face in a corner, and heaved as if with
sobs. Father closed his eyes slowly and
opened them slowly&mdash;amused, I thought.
The mother had been reading the leaf all
the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! <em>very</em> interesting!&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I suppose now the worst of it is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All's quiet for to-night, anyhow,&rdquo; said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Father, &ldquo;but I wish he could see someone
about to-morrow; that's their last chance,
and they <em>may</em>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He ruffled up his
feathers, lifted first one foot and then the
other. &ldquo;The awkwardness is,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;if I say too much and they do get the
jars, there's one risk; and if there's no
warning and they get them, there's another
risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if there <em>is</em> a warning and they
<em>don't</em> get them,&rdquo; said she, very sensibly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to be sure, that would be better,
even though we don't know much about him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where do you suppose he is, and
whom ought he to see?&rdquo; (It was just
what I wanted to know, and I thanked her.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, as to the first, I suspect he's
outside; there is someone there, and why
they should stop there all this time unless
they're listening, I don't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious! listening to our private
conversation! and me with my feathers all
anyhow!&rdquo; She began to peck at herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
vigorously; but this was straying from the
point, and annoyed me. However, Father
went slowly on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to that, I don't much care whether
he's listening or not. As to whom he ought
to see, that's rather more difficult. If he's
got as far as talking to any of the Right
People (he said this as if they had capital
letters), they'd know, of course; and some
of them down about the village, they'd
know; and the Old Mother knows, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about the boys?&rdquo; said she, pausing
in the middle of her toilet and poking
her head up at him. He wholly disdained
to answer, and merely butted at her with
his head, so that she slipped down off her
ledge several inches, with a great scrabbling.
&ldquo;Oh, <em>don't</em>!&rdquo; she said peevishly, as she
climbed back. &ldquo;I'm all untidy again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, don't ask such ridiculous
questions. I shall buffle you with both
wings next time. And now, as soon as the
coast is clear, I shall be out and about.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
I took the hint and moved off, for I had
learnt as much perhaps as I could expect,
even if all was not yet plain; and before I
had gone many paces I was aware of the
pair both sailing smoothly off in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>I was &ldquo;seeing through&rdquo; a good deal
that evening; it is surprising what a lot of
coppers people drop, even on a field path;
surprising, too, in how many places there
lie, unsuspected, bones of men. Some things
I saw which were ugly and sad, like that,
but more that were amusing and even
exciting. There is one spot I could show
where four gold cups stand round what was
once a book, but the book is no more than
earth now. That, however, I did not see on
this particular evening.</p>

<p>What I remember best is a family of
young rabbits huddled round their parents
in a burrow, and the mother telling a story:
&ldquo;And so then he went a little farther and
found a dandelion, and stopped and sat up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and began to eat it. And when he had
eaten two large leaves and one little one,
he saw a fly on it&mdash;no, two flies; and then
he thought he had had enough of that
dandelion, and he went a little farther and
found another dandelion.&hellip;&rdquo; And so it
went on interminably, and entirely stupid,
like everything else I ever heard a rabbit
say, for they have forgotten all about their
ancestor, Brer Rabbit. However, the children
were absorbed in the story, so much
so that they never heard a stoat making
its way down the burrow. But I heard it,
and by stamping and driving my stick in I
was able to make it turn tail and go off,
cursing. All stoats, weasels, ferrets, polecats,
are of the wrong people, as you may
imagine, and so are most rats and bats.</p>

<p>At last I left off seeing through, by trying
not to do so, and went back to the
house, where I found all safe and quiet.</p>

<p>I ought to say that I had not as yet
tried speaking to any animal, even to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
cat when she scratched me, but I thought
I would try it now. So when she came
in at dinner-time and circled about, with
what I may call pious aspirations about
fish and other such things, I summoned up
my courage and said (using my voice in
the way I described, or rather did not
describe, before):</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to be told, &lsquo;If you are hungry,
you can eat dry bread.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was certainly horribly startled. At
first I thought she would have dashed up
the chimney or out of the window; but she
recovered pretty quickly and sat down, still
looking at me with intense surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I might have guessed,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;but dear! what a turn you did
give me! I feel quite faint; and gracious!
what a day it has been! When I found
you dozing off like a great&mdash;&mdash; Well, no
one wants to be rude, do they? but I can
tell you I had more than half a mind to
go at your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am glad you didn't,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and
really, you know, it wasn't my fault: it
was that stuff they were burning on the
path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that well enough,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;but to come back to the point, all this
anxiety has made me as empty in myself
as a clean saucer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I was saying; if you are
hungry, you can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say that again, say it just once more,&rdquo;
she said, and her eyes grew narrow as she
said it, &ldquo;and I shall&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall you do?&rdquo; I asked, for she
stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>She calmed herself. &ldquo;Oh, you know how
it is when one's been all excited-like and
worked up; we all say more than we mean.
But that about dry bread! Well, there!
I simply can't bear it. It's a wicked, cruel
untruth, that's what it is; and besides, you
<em>can't</em> be going to eat all the whole of what
she's put down for you.&rdquo; Excitement was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
coming on again, and she ended with a
loud ill-tempered mew.</p>

<p>Well, I gave her what she seemed to want,
and shortly after, worn out doubtless with
the fatigues of the day, she went to sleep
on a chair, not even caring to follow the
maid downstairs when things were cleared
away.</p>



<div class="new-h2"></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<h2>VI<br/> THE CAT, WAG, SLIM AND OTHERS</h2>


<p>I got out my precious casket. I sat by
the window and watched. The moon
shone out, the lid of the box loosened in
due course, and I touched my forehead
with the ointment. But neither at once
nor for some little time after did I notice
any fresh power coming to me.</p>

<p>With the moon, up came also the little
town, and no sooner were the doors of the
houses level with the grass than the boys
were out of them and running in some
numbers towards my window; in fact,
some slipped out of their own windows,
not waiting for the doors to be available.
Wag was the first. Slim, more sedate, came
among the crowd that followed. These were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
still the only two who felt no hesitation
about talking to me. The others were all
fully occupied in exploring the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; I said (after some sort
of how-do-you-do's had been exchanged),
&ldquo;you'll be flying all over the place, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Wag, shortly. &ldquo;But I want
to know&mdash;I say, Slim, what was it we
wanted first?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn't there a message from your
father?&rdquo; said Slim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course. &lsquo;If they're about
the house,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;give them horseshoes;
if there's a bat-ball, squirt at it&rsquo;: he
thinks there's a squirt in the tool-house&mdash;Oh,
there's the cat; I must&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; After
delivering all this in one sentence, he rushed
to the edge of the table and took a kind
of header into the midst of the unfortunate
animal, who, however, only moaned or
crowed without waking, and turned partly
over on her back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Slim remained sitting on a book and
gazing soberly at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it's very kind of Wag's
father to send me a message, but I must
say I can't make much of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slim nodded. &ldquo;So he said, and he said
you'd see when the time came; of course
I don't know, myself; I've never seen a
bat-ball. Wag says he has, but you never
know with Wag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must do the best I can, I suppose;
but look here, Slim, I wish you
could tell me one or two things. What
<em>are</em> you? What do they call you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They call me Slim: and the whole of
us they call the Right People,&rdquo; said Slim;
&ldquo;but it's no good asking us much, because we
don't know, and besides, it isn't good for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, our job is to keep the
little things right, and if we do more than
that, or if we try to find out much more,
then we burst.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
&ldquo;And is that the end of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; he said cheerfully, &ldquo;but
that's one of the things it's no good asking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you don't do your job, what
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then they get smaller and have no
sense.&rdquo; (He said <em>they</em>, not <em>we</em>, I noticed.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. Well now, you go to school,
don't you?&rdquo; He nodded. &ldquo;What for?
Isn't that likely to be bad for you?&rdquo; (I
hardly liked to say &ldquo;make you burst.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you see, it's to learn
our job. We have to be told what used to
go on, so as we can put things right, or
keep them right. And the owls, you see,
they remember a long way back, but they
don't know any more than we do about the
swell things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was very shy about putting the next
question I had in mind, but I felt I must.
&ldquo;Now do you know how old you are, or how
long it takes you to grow up, or how&mdash;how
long you go on when you <em>are</em> grown up!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
He pressed his hands to his head, and I
was dreadfully afraid for the moment that
it might be swelling and would burst; but
it was not so bad as that. After a few
seconds he looked up and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it's seven times seven moons
since I went to school and seven times
seven times seven moons before I grow up;
and the rest is no good asking. But it's all
right&rdquo;; upon which he smiled.</p>

<p>And this, I may say, was the most part
of what I ventured to ask any of them
about themselves. But at other times I
gathered that as long as they &ldquo;did their
job&rdquo; nothing could injure them; and they
were regularly measured&mdash;all of them&mdash;to
see if they were getting smaller, and a
careful record kept. But if anyone lost as
much as a quarter of his height, he was
doomed, and he crept off out of the settlement.
Whether such a one ever came back
I could not be sure; most of the failures
(and they were not common) went and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
lived in hollow trees or by brooks, and
were happy enough, but in a feeble way,
not remembering much, nor able to make
anything; and it was supposed that very
slowly they shrunk to the size of a pin's
point, and probably to nothing. All the
same, it was believed that they <em>could</em> recover.
Many other things that <em>you</em> would
have asked, I did not, being anxious to
avoid giving trouble.</p>

<p>But this time, anyhow, I felt I had catechized
Slim long enough, so I broke off and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can Wag be doing all this while?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's no knowing,&rdquo; said Slim. &ldquo;But
he's very quiet for him; either he's doing
something awful, or he's asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw him with the cat last,&rdquo; I said;
&ldquo;you might go and look at her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked to the edge of the table, and
said, &ldquo;Why, he <em>is</em> asleep!&rdquo; And so he
was, with his head on the cat's chest, under
her chin, which she had turned up; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
she had put her front paws together over
the top of his head. As for the others, I
descried them sitting in a circle in a
corner of the room, also very quiet. (I
imagine they were a little afraid of doing
much without Wag, and also of waking
him.) But I could not make out what
they were doing, so I asked Slim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Racing earwigs, I should think,&rdquo; he
said, with something of contempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope they won't leave them
about when they go. I don't like earwigs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who does?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but they'll
take them away all right; they're prize
ones, some of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went over and looked at the racing for
a little. The course was neatly marked out
with small lights sprouting out of the boards,
and the circle was at the winning-post, the
starters being at the other end, some six
feet away. I watched one heat. The earwigs
seemed to me neither very speedy nor
very intelligent, and all except one were apt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to stop in mid-course and engage in personal
encounters with each other.</p>

<p>I was beginning to wonder how long this
would go on, when Wag woke up. Like
most of us, he was not willing to allow
that he had been asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I'd just lie down a bit,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and then I didn't want to bustle
your cat, so I stopped there. And now I
want to know&mdash;Slim, I say, what was it
you were asking me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me asking you? I don't know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do; what he was doing
the other time before we came in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn't ask you that; you asked me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn't matter who asked.&rdquo;
(Turning to me): &ldquo;What <em>were</em> you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Was it these
things I was using&rdquo; (taking up a pack of
cards), &ldquo;or something like this?&rdquo; (I held
up a book.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that one. What were you doing
with it? What's it for?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
&ldquo;We call it reading a book,&rdquo; and I tried
to explain what the idea was, and read out
a few lines; it happened to be <cite>Pickwick</cite>.
They were absorbed. Slim said, half to
himself, &ldquo;Something like a glass,&rdquo; which
I thought quite meaningless at the time.
Then I showed them a picture in another
book. That they made out very quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when's it going to move on?&rdquo;
said Slim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Ours stop just like
that always. Do yours move on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course they do; look here.&rdquo; He
lay down on the tablecloth and pressed his
forehead on it, but evidently could make
nothing of it. &ldquo;It's all rough,&rdquo; he said.
I gave him a sheet of paper. &ldquo;That's
better;&rdquo; and he lay down again in the
same posture for a few seconds. Then he
got up and began rubbing the paper all
over with the palms of his hands. As he
did so a coloured picture came out pretty
quickly, and when it was finished he drew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
aside to let me see, and said, somewhat
bashfully, &ldquo;I don't think I've got it <em>quite</em>
right, but I meant it for what happened
the other evening.&rdquo; He had certainly not
got it right as far as I was concerned. It
was a view of the window of the house,
seen from outside by moonlight, and there
was a back view of a row of figures with
their elbows on the sill. So far, so good;
but inside the open window was standing a
figure which was plainly&mdash;much too plainly,
I thought&mdash;meant for me; far too short
and fat, far too red-faced, and with an
owlish expression which I am sure I never
wear. This person was now seen to move
his hand&mdash;a very poor hand, with only
about three fingers&mdash;to his side, and pull,
apparently, out of his body, a round object
more or less like a watch (at any rate it
was white on one side with black marks,
and yellow on the other) and lay it down
in front of him. At this the figures at the
window-sill threw up their arms in all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
directions and fell or slid down like so
many dolls. Then the picture began to get
fainter, and disappeared from the paper.
Slim looked at me expectantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it's very interesting to
see how you do it, but is that the best
likeness of me that you can make?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's wrong with it?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Isn't
it handsome enough or something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I heard Wag throw himself down on the
table, and, looking at him, I saw that he
had got both hands pressed over his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I ask what the joke is?&rdquo; I said
rather dryly (for it is surprising how touchy
one can be over one's personal appearance,
even at my time of life). He looked up
for an instant at me, and then gasped and
hid his face again. Slim went up to him
and kicked him in the ribs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's your manners?&rdquo; he said in a
loud whisper. Wag rolled over and sat up,
wiping his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm very sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm sure I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
don't know what I was laughing for.&rdquo; Slim
whistled. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Wag, &ldquo;what <em>was</em>
I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Him, of course, and you know perfectly
well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, was I? Well, perhaps you'll tell
me what there is to laugh at about him?&rdquo;
said Wag, rather basely, I thought; so, as
Slim put his finger to his lip and looked
unhappy, I interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get up a minute, Wag,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I
want to see something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said he, jumping up at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand back to back with Slim, if you
don't mind. That's it. Dear me! I
thought you were taller than that&mdash;you
looked to me taller last night. My mistake,
I dare say. All right, thanks.&rdquo; But there
they stood, gazing at each other with horror,
and I felt I had been trifling with
a most serious subject, so I laughed and
said, &ldquo;Don't disturb yourselves. I was
only chaffing you, Wag, because you seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to be doing something of the kind to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slim understood, and heaved a sigh of
relief. Wag sat down on a book and looked
reproachfully upon me. Neither said a word.
I was very much ashamed, and begged their
pardon as nicely as I knew how. Luckily
Wag was soon convinced that I was not in
earnest, and he recovered his spirits directly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All <em>right</em>,&rdquo; he said, nodding at me;
&ldquo;did I hear you say you didn't like earwigs?
That's worth remembering, Slim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This reduced me at once; I tried to
point out that he had begun it, and that it
would be a mean revenge, and very hard
on the earwigs, if he filled my room with
them, for I should be obliged to kill all I
could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they needn't be real
earwigs; my own tickle every bit as much
as real ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was no better for me, and I tried
to make more appeals to his better feelings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
He did not seem to be listening very attentively,
though his eyes were fixed on me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What's that on your neck?&rdquo; he said
suddenly, and at the same moment I felt a
procession of legs walking over my skin. I
brushed at it hastily, and something seemed
to fall on the table. &ldquo;No, the other side
I mean,&rdquo; said he, and again I felt the same
horrid tickling and went through the same
exercises, with a face, I've no doubt, contorted
with terror. Anyhow, it seemed to
amuse them very much; Wag, in fact, was
quite unable to speak, and could only point.
It was dull of me not to have realized at
once that these were &ldquo;his&rdquo; earwigs and not
real ones. But now I did, and though I still
felt the tickling, I did not move, but sat
down and gazed severely at him. Soon he
got the better of his mirth and said, &ldquo;I
think we are quits now.&rdquo; Then, with sudden
alarm, &ldquo;I say, what's become of the
others? The bell hasn't gone, has it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
you hadn't been making all this disturbance,
perhaps we might have heard it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a flying leap&mdash;an extraordinary
feat it was&mdash;from the edge of the table to
a chair in the window, scrambled up to
the sill, and gazed out. &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo;
he said, in a faint voice of infinite relief;
let himself down limply to the floor, and
climbed slowly up my leg to his former
place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the bell hasn't gone, it
seems, but where are the rest? I've hardly
seen anything of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>you</em> go and find 'em, Slim; I'm
worn out with all these frights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slim went to the farther end of the
table, prospected, and returned. He reported
them &ldquo;all right, but they're having
rather a slow time of it, I think.&rdquo; I, too,
got up, walked round, and looked; they
were seated in a solemn circle on the floor
round the cat, who was now curled up and
fast asleep on a round footstool. Not a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
word was being said by anybody. I thought
I had better address them, so I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I'm afraid I've been very
inattentive to you this evening. Isn't there
anything I can do to amuse you? Won't
you come up on the table? You're welcome
to walk up my leg if you find that
convenient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was almost sorry I had spoken the
moment after, for they made but one rush
at my legs as I stood by the table, and the
sensation was rather like that, I imagine, of
a swarm of rats climbing up one's trousers.
However, it was over in a few seconds, and
all of them&mdash;over a dozen&mdash;were with Wag
and Slim on the table, except one, who,
whether by mistake or on purpose, went on
climbing me by way of my waistcoat buttons,
rather deliberately, until he reached
my shoulder. I didn't object, of course,
but I turned round (which made him catch
at my ear) and went back to my chair,
seated in which I felt rather as if I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
presiding at a meeting. The one on my
shoulder sat down and, I thought, folded
his arms and looked at his friends with
some triumph. Wag evidently took this to
be a liberty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My word!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what do you
mean by it, Wisp? Come off it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wisp was a little daunted, as I judged by
his fidgeting somewhat, but put a bold
face on it and said, &ldquo;Why should I come
off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put in a word: &ldquo;I don't mind his
being here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say not; that's not the point,&rdquo;
said Wag. &ldquo;Are you coming down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Wisp, &ldquo;not for you.&rdquo; But
his tone was rather blustering than brave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, don't then,&rdquo; said Wag; and
I expected him to run up and pull Wisp
down by the legs, but he didn't do that.
He took something out of the breast of his
tunic, put it in his mouth, lay down on
his stomach, and, with his eyes on Wisp,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
puffed out his cheeks. Two or three seconds
passed, during which I felt Wisp shifting
about on his perch, and breathing quickly.
Then he gave a sharp shriek, which went
right through my head, slipped rapidly
down my chest and legs and on to the
floor, where he continued to squeal and to
run about like a mad thing, to the great
amusement of everyone on the table.</p>

<p>Then I saw what was the matter. All
round his head were a multitude of little
sparks, which flew about him like a swarm
of bees, every now and then settling and
coming off again, and, I suppose, burning
him every time; if he beat them off, they
attacked his hands, so he was in a bad
way. After watching him for about a minute
from the edge of the table, Wag called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you apologize?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he screamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Wag; &ldquo;stand still!
stand still, you bat! How can I get 'em
back if you don't?&rdquo; Wag was back to me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and I couldn't see what he did, but Wisp
sat down on the carpet free of sparks, and
wiped his face and neck with his handkerchief
for some time, while the rest gradually
recovered from their laughter. &ldquo;You can
come up again now,&rdquo; said Wag; and so he
did, though he was slow and shy about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn't he send sparks at Wag?&rdquo;
said I to Slim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hasn't got 'em to send,&rdquo; was the
answer. &ldquo;It's only the Captain of the
moon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well now, what about a little peace and
quiet?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And, you know, I've
never been introduced to you all properly.
Wouldn't it be a good idea to do that,
before the bell goes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Wag. &ldquo;We'll <em>do</em> it
properly. You bring 'em up one at a
time, Slim, and&rdquo; (to me) &ldquo;you put your
sun-hand out on the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(<i>I</i>: &ldquo;Sun-hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Wag</i>: &ldquo;Yes, sun-hand; don't you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
know?&rdquo; He held up his right hand, then
his left: &ldquo;Sun-hand, Moon-hand, Day-hand,
Night-hand, Star-hand, Cloud-hand,
and so on.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>I</i>: &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>This was done, and meanwhile Slim
formed the troop into a queue and beckoned
them up one by one. Wag stood on a
book on the right and proclaimed the name
of each. First he had made me arrange my
right hand edgeways on the table, with the
forefinger out. Then &ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; said Wag.
Gold stepped forward and made a lovely
bow, which I returned with an inclination
of my head, then took as much of my
forefinger top joint in his right hand as he
could manage, bent over it and shook it or
tried to, and then took up a position on
the left and watched the next comer. The
ceremony was the same for everyone, but
not all the bows were equally elegant;
some of the boys were jocular, and shook
my finger with both hands and a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
display of effort. These were frowned upon
by Wag. The names (I need not set them
all down now) were all of the same kind
as you have heard; there was Red, Wise,
Dart, Sprat, and so on. After Wisp, who
came last and was rather humble, Wag
called out Slim, and, after him, descended
and presented himself in the same form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;perhaps you'll tell
us <em>your</em> name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did so (one is always a little shamefaced
about it, I don't know why) in full.
He whistled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what's the easiest
you can do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After some thought I said, &ldquo;What about
M or N?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much better! If M's all right for you,
it'll do for us.&rdquo; So M was agreed upon.</p>

<p>I was still rather afraid that the rank
and file had been passing a dull evening
and would not come again, and I tried to
express as much to them. But they said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
&ldquo;Dull? Oh no, M; why we've found out
all sorts of things!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really? What sort of things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, inside the wall in that corner
there's the biggest spider I've ever seen, for
one thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I hate 'em.
I hope it can't get out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have to-night if we hadn't
stopped up the hole. Something's been
helping it to gnaw through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has it?&rdquo; said Wag. &ldquo;My word! that
looks bad. What was it made the hole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some called out, &ldquo;A bat,&rdquo; and some
&ldquo;A rat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn't matter much for that,&rdquo; said
Slim, &ldquo;so long as it's safe now. Where is
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone down to the bottom and saying
awful things,&rdquo; Red answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I <em>am</em> obliged to you,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There's a lot of this stuff under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
floor,&rdquo; said Dart, pointing with his foot at
a half-crown which lay on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there? Whereabouts?&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;Oh, but I was forgetting; I can look
after that myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course you can,&rdquo; they said;
&ldquo;and lots of things happened here before
you came. We were watching. The old
man and the woman, they were the worst,
weren't they, Red?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you've been here before?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, but to-night we were looking at
them, like we do at school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was beyond me, and I thought it
would be of no use to ask for more explanations.
Besides, just at this moment we
heard the bell. They all clambered down
either me or the chairs or the tablecloth.
Slim lingered a moment to say, &ldquo;You'll
look out, won't you?&rdquo; and then followed
the rest on to the window-sill, where, taking
the time from Captain Wag, they all stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in a row, bowed with their caps off, straightened
up again, each sang one note, which
combined into a wonderful chord, faced
round and disappeared. I followed them to
the window and saw the inhabitants of the
house separating and going to their homes
with the young ones capering round them.
One or two of the elders&mdash;Wag's father in
particular&mdash;looked up at me, paused in their
walk, and bowed gravely, which courtesy I
returned. I went on gazing until the lawn
was a blank once more, and then, closing
and fastening the sitting-room window, I
betook myself to the bedroom.</p>



<div class="new-h2"></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>
<h2>VII<br/> THE BAT-BALL</h2>


<p>It had certainly been an eventful day and
evening, and I felt that my adventures
could not be quite at an end yet, for I had
still to find out what new power or sense
the Fourth Jar had brought me. I stood
and thought, and tried quite vainly to
detect some difference in myself. And then
I went to the window and drew the curtain
aside and looked out on the road, and
within a few minutes I began to understand.</p>

<p>There came walking rapidly along the
road a young man, and he turned in at the
garden gate and came straight up the path
to the house door. I began to be surprised,
not at his coming, for it was not so
very late, but at the look of him. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
young, as I said, rather red-faced, but not
bad-looking; of the class of a farmer, I
thought. He wore biggish brown whiskers&mdash;which
is not common nowadays&mdash;and
his hair was rather long at the back&mdash;which
also is not common with young men
who want to look smart&mdash;but his hat, and
his clothes generally, were the really odd
part of him. The hat was a sort of low
top-hat, with a curved brim; it spread
out at the top and it was brushed rough
instead of smooth. His coat was a blue
swallow-tail with brass buttons. He had a
broad tie wound round and round his neck,
and a Gladstone collar. His trousers were
tight all the way down and had straps
under his feet. To put it in the dullest,
shortest way, he was &ldquo;dressed in the
fashion of eighty or ninety years ago,&rdquo; as
we read in the ghost stories. Evidently he
knew his way about very well. He came
straight up to the front door and, as far as
I could tell, into the house, but I did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
hear the door open or shut or any steps on
the stairs. He must, I thought, be in my
landlady's parlour downstairs.</p>

<p>I turned away from the window, and
there was the next surprise. It was as if
there was no wall between me and the
sitting-room. I saw straight into it. There
was a fire in the grate, and by it were
sitting face to face an old man and an old
woman. I thought at once of what one of
the boys had said, and I looked curiously at
them. They were, you would have said, as
fine specimens of an old-fashioned yeoman
and his wife as anyone could wish to see.
The man was hale and red-faced, with grey
whiskers, smiling as he sat bolt upright in
his arm-chair. The old lady was rosy and
smiling too, with a smart silk dress and a
smart cap, and tidy ringlets on each side
of her face&mdash;a regular picture of wholesome
old age; and yet I hated them both. The
young man, their son, I suppose, was in
the room standing at the door with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
hat in his hand, looking timidly at them.
The old man turned half round in his chair,
looked at him, turned down the corners of
his mouth, looked across at the old lady,
and they both smiled as if they were
amused. The son came farther into the
room, put his hat down, leaned with both
hands on the table, and began to speak
(though nothing could be heard) with an
earnestness that was painful to see, because
I could be certain his pleading would be
of no use; sometimes he spread out his
hands and shook them, every now and
again he brushed his eyes. He was very
much moved, and so was I, merely watching
him. The old people were not; they
leaned forward a little in their chairs and
sometimes smiled at each other&mdash;again as if
they were amused. At last he had done,
and stood with his hands before him, quivering
all over. His father and mother leaned
back in their chairs and looked at each
other. I think they said not a single word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
The son caught up his hat, turned round,
and went quickly out of the room. Then
the old man threw back his head and
laughed, and the old lady laughed too, not
so boisterously.</p>

<p>I turned back to the window. It was as
I expected. Outside the garden gate, in
the road, a young slight girl in a large
poke-bonnet and shawl and rather short-skirted
dress was waiting, in great anxiety,
as I could see by the way she held to the
railings. Her face I could not see. The
young man came out; she clasped her
hands, he shook his head; they went off
together slowly up the road, he with bowed
shoulders, supporting her, she, I dare say,
crying. Again I looked round to the sitting-room.
The wall hid it now.</p>

<p>It sounds a dull ordinary scene enough,
but I can assure you it was horribly disturbing
to watch, and the cruel calm way
in which the father and mother, who looked
so nice and worthy and were so abominable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
treated their son, was like nothing I had
ever seen.</p>

<p>Of course I know now what the effect of
the Fourth Jar was; it made me able to
see what had happened in any place. I
did not yet know how far back the memories
would go, or whether I was obliged to
see them if I did not want to. But it was
clear to me that the boys were sometimes
taught in this way. &ldquo;We were watching
them like we do at school,&rdquo; one of them
said, and though the grammar was poor,
the meaning was plain, and I would ask
Slim about it when we next met. Meanwhile
I must say I hoped the gift would
not go on working instead of letting me go
to sleep. It did not.</p>

<p>Next day I met my landlady employing
herself in the garden, and asked her about
the people who had formerly lived in the
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I can tell you
about them, for my father he remembered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
old Mr. and Mrs. Eld quite well when he
was a slip of a lad. They wasn't liked in
the place, neither of them, partly through
bein' so hard-like to their workpeople, and
partly from them treating their only son
so bad&mdash;I mean to say turning him right
off because he married without asking permission.
Well, no doubt, that's what he
shouldn't have done, but my father said it
was a very nice respectable young girl he
married, and it do seem hard for them
never to say a word of kindness all those
years and leave every penny away from
the young people. What become of them,
do you say, sir? Why, I believe they
emigrated away to the United States of
America and never was heard of again, but
the old people they lived on here, and I
never heard but what they was easy in
their minds right up to the day of their
death. Nice-looking old people they was
too, my father used to say; seemed as if
butter wouldn't melt in their mouths, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the saying is. Now I don't know when
I've thought of them last, but I recollect
my father speaking of them as well,
and the way they're spoke of on their stone
that lays just to the right-hand side as
you go up the churchyard path&mdash;well, you'd
think there never was such people. But I
believe that was put up by them that got the
property; now what was that name again?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But about that time I thought I must be
getting on. I also thought (as before) that
it would be well for me not to go very far
away from the house.</p>

<p>As I strolled up the road I pondered
over the message which Wag's father had
been so good as to send me. &ldquo;If they're
about the house, give them horseshoes; if
there's a bat-ball, squirt at it. I think
there's a squirt in the tool-house.&rdquo; All very
well, no doubt. I had one horseshoe, but
that was not much, and I could explore
the tool-house and borrow the garden squirt.
But more horseshoes?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
At that moment I heard a squeak and
a rustle in the hedge, and could not help
poking my stick into it to see what had
made the noise. The stick clinked against
something with its iron ferrule. An old
horseshoe!&mdash;evidently shown to me on
purpose by a friendly creature. I picked it
up, and, not to make a long story of it, I
was helped by much the same devices to
increase my collection to four. And now I
felt it would be wise to turn back.</p>

<p>As I turned into the back garden and
came in sight of the little potting-shed or
tool-house or whatever it was, I started.
Someone was just coming out of it. I gave
a loud cough. The party turned round
hastily; it was an old man in a sleeved
waistcoat, made up, I thought, to look like
an &ldquo;odd man.&rdquo; He touched his hat civilly
enough, and showed no surprise; but, oh,
horror! he held in his hand the garden
squirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;going to do a bit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of watering?&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;Just stepped
up to borrer this off the lady; there's a
lot of fly gets on the plants this weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say there is. By the way, what
a lot of horseshoes you people leave about.
How many do you think I picked up this
morning just along the road? Look here!&rdquo;
and I held one out to him, and his hand
came slowly out to meet it, as though he
could not keep it back.</p>

<p>His face wrinkled up into a horrible
scowl, and what he was going to say I don't
know, but just then his hand clutched the
horseshoe and he gave a shout of pain,
dropped the squirt and the horseshoe,
whipped round as quick as any young man
could, and was off round the corner of the
shed before I had really taken in what was
happening. Before I tried to see what had
become of him, I snatched up the squirt
and the horseshoe, and almost dropped
them again. Both were pretty hot&mdash;the
squirt much the hotter of the two; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
both of them cooled down in a few seconds.
By that time my old man was completely
out of sight. And I should not wonder if
he was away some time; for perhaps you
know, and perhaps you don't know, the
effect of an old horseshoe on that sort of
people. Not only is it of iron, which they
can't abide, but when they see or, still
more, touch the shoe, they have to go over
all the ground that the shoe went over
since it was last in the blacksmith's hands.
Only I doubt if the same shoe will work
for more than one witch or wizard. Anyway,
I put that one aside when I went
indoors. And then I sat and wondered
what would come next, and how I could
best prepare for it. It occurred to me that
it would do no harm to put one of the
shoes where it couldn't be seen at once,
and it also struck me that under the rug
just inside the bedroom door would not be
a bad place. So there I put it, and then
fell to smoking and reading.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
A knock at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said I, a little curious; but
no, it was only the maid. As she passed
me (which she did quickly) I heard her
mutter something about &ldquo;'ankerchieves for
the wash,&rdquo; and I thought there was something
not quite usual about the voice. So
I looked round. She was back to me, but
the dress and the height and the hair was
what I was accustomed to see. Into the
bedroom she hurried, and the next thing
was a scream like that of at least two cats
in agony! I could just see her leap into
the air, come down again on the rug, scream
again, and then bundle, hopping, limping&mdash;I
don't know what&mdash;out of the room and
down the stairs. I did catch sight of her
feet, though; they were bare, they were
greenish, and they were webbed, and I
think there were some large white blisters
on the soles of them. You would have
thought that the commotion would have
brought the household about my ears; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
it did not, and I can only suppose that
they heard no more of it than they did of
the things which the birds and so on say
to each other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next, please!&rdquo; said I, as I lighted a
pipe; but if you will believe it, there was
no next. Lunch, the afternoon, tea, all
passed by, and I was completely undisturbed.
&ldquo;They must be saving up for the
bat-ball,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;What in the world
can it be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As candle-time came on, and the moon
began to make herself felt, I took up my
old position at the window, with the garden
squirt at hand and two full jugs of water
on the floor&mdash;plenty more to be got from
the bathroom if wanted. The leaden box
of the Five Jars was in the right place for
the moonbeams to fall on it.&hellip; But no
moonbeams would touch it to-night! Why
was this? There were no clouds. Yet,
between the orb of the moon and my box,
there was some obstruction. High up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the sky was a dancing film, thick enough to
cast a shadow on the area of the window;
and ever, as the moon rode higher in the
heavens, this obstruction became more solid.
It seemed gradually to get its bearings and
settle into the place where it would shut
off the light from the box most completely.
I began to guess. It was the bat-ball;
neither more nor less than a dense
cloud of bats, gradually forming itself into
a solid ball, and coming lower, and nearer
to my window. Soon they were only about
thirty feet off, and I felt that the moment
was come.</p>

<p>I have never much liked bats or desired
their company, and now, as I studied them
through the glass, and saw their horrid
little wicked faces and winking wings, I
felt justified in trying to make things as
unpleasant for them as I could. I charged
the squirt and let fly, and again, and again,
as quick as I could fill it. The water
spread a bit before it reached the ball, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
not too much to spoil the effect; and the
effect was almost alarming. Some hundreds
of bats all shrieking out at once, and
shrieking with rage and fear (not merely
from the excitement of chasing flies, as
they generally do). Dozens of them dropping
away, with wings too soaked to fly,
some on to the grass, where they hopped
and fluttered and rolled in ecstasies of passion,
some into bushes, one or two plumb
on to the path, where they lay motionless;
that was the first tableau. Then came a
new feature. From both sides there darted
into the heart of the ball two squadrons of
figures flying at great speed (though without
wings) and perfectly horizontal, with
arms joined and straight out in front of
them, and almost at the same instant seven
or eight more plunged into the ball from
above, as if taking headers. The boys were
out.</p>

<p>I stopped squirting, for I did not know
whether the water would fell them as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
felled the bats; but a shrill cry rose from
below:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, M! go on, M!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I aimed again, and it was time, for a
knot of bats just then detached itself from
the main body and flew full-face towards
me. My shot caught the middle one on
the snout, and as I swung the squirt to
left and right, it disabled four or five
others, and discouraged the rest. Meanwhile
the ball was cloven again and again
by the arms of the flying squadrons, which
shot through it from side to side and from
top to bottom (though never, as appeared
later, quite through the middle), and though
it kept closing up again, it was plainly
growing smaller as more and more of the
bats outside, which were exposed to the
squirt, dropped away.</p>

<p>I suddenly felt something alight on my
shoulder, and a voice said in my ear, &ldquo;Wag
says if you <em>could</em> throw a shoe into the
middle now, he believes it would finish them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Can you?&rdquo; It was, I think, Dart who had
been sent with the message.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horseshoes, I suppose he means,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;I'll try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait till we're out of the way,&rdquo; said
Dart, and was off.</p>

<p>In a moment more I heard&mdash;not what I
was rather expecting, a horn of Elf-land, but
two strokes on the bell. I saw the figures
of the boys shoot up and away to left and
right, leaving the bat-ball clear, and the
bats shrieked aloud, I dare say in triumph
at the enemy's retreat.</p>

<p>There were two horseshoes left. I had
no idea how they would fly, and I had not
much confidence in my power of aiming;
but it must be tried, and I threw them
edgeways, like quoits. The first skimmed
the top of the ball, the second went straight
through the middle. Something which the
bats in the very centre were holding&mdash;something
soft&mdash;was pierced by it, and
burst. I think it must have been a globe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of jelly-like stuff in a thin skin. The contents
spurted out on to some of the bats,
and seemed to scald the fur off them in an
instant and singe up all the membranes of
their wings. They fell down at once, with
broken screams. The rest darted off in every
direction, and the ball was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don't be long,&rdquo; said a voice from
the window-sill.</p>

<p>I thought I knew what was meant, and
looked to the leaden casket. As if to make
up for lost time, the moonbeam had already
made an opening all round the part on
which it shone, and I had but to turn the
other side towards it&mdash;not even very slowly&mdash;to
get the whole lid free. After cleansing
my hands in the water, I made trial of the
Fifth Jar, and, as I replaced it, a chorus
of applause and cheering came up from
below.</p>

<p>The Jars were mine.</p>



<div class="new-h2"></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<h2>VIII<br/> WAG AT HOME</h2>


<p>There was no scrambling up to the
window-sill this time. My visitors
shot in like so many arrows, and &ldquo;brought
up&rdquo; on their hands on the tablecloth, or
lit on their feet on the top rail of a chair-back
or on my shoulder, as the fancy took
them. It would be tedious to go through
all the congratulations and thanks which I
offered, and indeed received, for it was important
to them that the Jars should not
get into wrong hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father says,&rdquo; said Wag, who was sitting
on a book, as usual&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, what fun it is
to be able to fly again!&rdquo; And he darted
straight and level and butted head first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
into the back of&mdash;Sprat, was it?&mdash;who was
standing near the edge of the table. Sprat
was merely propelled into the air a foot
or two off, and remained standing, but, of
course, turned round and told Wag what he
thought of him. Wag returned contentedly
to his book. &ldquo;Father says,&rdquo; he resumed,
&ldquo;he hopes you'll come and see us now. He
says you did all right, and he's very glad
the stuff got spilt, because they'll take
moons and moons to get as much of it
together again. He says they meant to
squirt some of it on you when they got
near enough, and while you were trying to
get it off they'd have got hold of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
pointed to the box of jars; there was a
shyness about mentioning it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father's very kind,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and
I hope you'll thank him from me; but I
don't quite see how I'm to get into your
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fancy you not knowing that!&rdquo; said
Wag. &ldquo;I'll tell him you'll come.&rdquo; And he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
was out of the window. As usual, I had
recourse to Slim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you did put some on your chest,
didn't you?&rdquo; was Slim's question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but nothing came of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe you can go pretty well
anywhere with that, if you think you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I fly, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I should say not; I mean, if you
couldn't fly before, you can't now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you fly? I don't see any
wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we never have wings, and I'm
rather glad we don't; the things that have
them are always going wrong somehow.
We just work it in the proper way with
our backs, and there you are; like this.&rdquo;
He made a slight movement of his shoulders,
and was standing in the air an inch off the
table. &ldquo;You never tried that, I suppose?&rdquo;
he went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;only in dreams,&rdquo; which
evidently meant nothing to him. &ldquo;Well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
now,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do you tell me that if I
went to Wag's house now, I could get
inside it? Look at the size I am!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn't look as if you could,&rdquo; he
agreed, &ldquo;but my father said just the same
as Wag's father about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Wag shot on to my shoulder. &ldquo;Are
you coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if I knew how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, come and try, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, as you please; anything to
oblige.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I picked up a hat and went downstairs.
All the rest followed, if you can call it
following, when there was at least as much
flying up steps and in and out of banisters as
going down. When we were out on the path,
Wag said with more seriousness than
usual:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you do mean to come into our
house, don't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I do, if you wish me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that's all right. This way.
There's Father.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
We were on the grass now, and very
long it was, and nice and wet I thought I
should be with all the dew. As I looked
up to see the elder Wag I very nearly fell
over a large log which it was very careless
of anyone to have left about. But here
was Mr. Wag within a yard of me, and to
my extreme surprise he was quite a sizeable
man of middle height, with a sensible,
good-humoured face, in which I could see a
strong likeness to his son. We both bowed,
and then shook hands, and Mr. Wag was
very complimentary and pleasant about the
occurrences of the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We've pretty well got the mess cleared
up, you see. Yes, don't be alarmed,&rdquo; he
went on, and took hold of my elbow, for he
had, no doubt, seen a bewildered look in
my eyes. The fact was, as I suppose you
have made out, not that he had grown to
my size, but that I had come down to his.
&ldquo;Things right themselves; you'll have no
difficulty about getting back when the time
comes. But come in, won't you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
You will expect me to describe the house
and the furniture. I shall not, further than
to say that it seemed to me to be of a
piece with the fashion in which the boys
were dressed; that is, it was like my idea
of a good citizen's house in Queen Elizabeth's
time; and I shall not describe Mrs.
Wag's costume. She did not wear a ruff,
anyhow.</p>

<p>Wag, who had been darting about in the
air while we walked to his home, followed
us in on foot. He now reached up to my
shoulder. Slim, who came in too, was
shorter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven't you got any sisters?&rdquo; I took
occasion to say to Wag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;don't you see
'em? Oh! I forgot. Come out, you
sillies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon which there came forward three
nice little girls, each of whom was putting
away something into a kind of locket which
she wore round her neck. No, it is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
use asking me what <em>their</em> dresses were like;
none at all. All I know is that they curtsied
to me very nicely, and that when we
all sat down the youngest came and put
herself on my knee as if it was a matter of
course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn't I see you before?&rdquo; I asked
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose because the flowers were in
our hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show him what you mean, my dear,&rdquo;
said her father. &ldquo;He doesn't know our
ways yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly she opened her locket and
took out of it a small blue flower, looking
as if it was made of enamel, and stuck it
in her hair over her forehead. As she did
so she vanished, but I could still feel the
weight of her on my knee. When she took
it out again (as no doubt she did) she
became visible, put it back in the locket,
and smiled agreeably at me. Naturally, I
had a good many questions to ask about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
this, but you will hardly expect me to put
them all down. Becoming invisible in this
way was a privilege which the girls always
had till they were grown up, and I suppose
I may say &ldquo;came out.&rdquo; Of course, if they
presumed on it, the lockets were taken away
for the time being&mdash;just in the same way
as the boys were sometimes stopped from
flying, as we have seen. But their own
families could always see them, or at any
rate the flowers in their hair, and they
could always see each other.</p>

<p>But dear me! how much am I to tell
of the conversation of that evening? One
part at least: I remembered to ask about
the pictures of the things that had happened
in former times in places where I
chanced to be. Was I obliged to see them,
whether they were pleasant or horrible?
&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; they said; if you shut your
eyes from below&mdash;that meant pushing up
the lower eyelids&mdash;you would be rid of
them; and you would only begin seeing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
them, either if you wanted to, or else if
you left your mind quite blank, and were
thinking of nothing in particular. Then
they would begin to come, and there was
no knowing how old they might be; that
depended on how angry or excited or happy
or sad the people had been to whom they
happened.</p>

<p>And that reminds me of another thing.
Wag had got rather fidgety while we were
talking, and was flying up to the ceiling
and down again, and walking on his hands,
and so forth, when his mother said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, do be quiet. Why don't you
take a glass and amuse yourself with it?
Here's the key of the cupboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She threw it to him and he caught it
and ran to a tall bureau opposite and
unlocked it. After humming and flitting
about in front of it for a little time, he
pulled a thing like a slate off a shelf where
there were a large number of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you got?&rdquo; said his mother.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
&ldquo;The one I didn't get to the end of
yesterday, about the dragon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that's a very good one,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;I used to be very fond of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I liked it awfully as far as I got,&rdquo; he
said, and was betaking himself to a settle
on the other side of the room when I asked
if I might see it, and he brought it to me.</p>

<p>It was just like a small looking-glass in
a frame, and the frame had one or two
buttons or little knobs on it. Wag put it
into my hand and then got behind me and
put his chin on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's where I'd got to,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he's
just going out through the forest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought at the first glance that I was
looking at a very good copy of a picture.
It was a knight on horseback, in plate-armour,
and the armour looked as if it had
really seen service. The horse was a massive
white beast, rather of the cart-horse
type, but not so &ldquo;hairy in the hoof&rdquo;; the
background was a wood, chiefly of oak-trees;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
but the undergrowth was wonderfully
painted. I felt that if I looked into
it I should see every blade of grass and
every bramble-leaf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; said Wag, and reached over
and moved one of the knobs. The knight
shook his rein, and the horse began to move
at a foot-pace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but he can't <em>hear</em> anything, Wag,&rdquo;
said his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you wanted to be quiet,&rdquo; said
Wag, &ldquo;but we'll have it aloud if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He slid aside another knob, and I began
to hear the tread of the horse and the
creaking of the saddle and the chink of
the armour, as well as a rising breeze which
now came sighing through the wood. Like
a cinema, you will say, of course. Well, it
was; but there was colour and sound, and
you could hold it in your hand, and it
wasn't a photograph, but the live thing
which you could stop at pleasure, and look
into every detail of it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Well, I went on reading, as you may say,
this glass. In a theatre, you know, if you
saw a knight riding through a forest, the
effect would be managed by making the
scenery slide backwards past him; and in
a cinema it could all be shortened up by
increasing the pace or leaving out part of
the film. Here it was not like that; we
seemed to be keeping pace and going along
with the knight. Presently he began to
sing. He had a loud voice and uttered his
words crisply, so that I had no difficulty in
making out the song. It was about a lady
who was very proud and haughty to him
and would have nothing to say to his suit,
and it declared that the only thing left
for him was to lay himself down under a
tree. But he seemed quite cheerful about
it, and indeed neither his complexion nor
the glance of his eye gave any sign that he
was suffering the pangs of hopeless love.</p>

<p>Suddenly his horse stopped short and
snorted uneasily. The knight left off singing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in the middle of a verse, looked earnestly
into the wood at the back of the picture,
and then out towards us, and then behind
him. He patted his horse's neck, and then,
humming to himself, put on his gauntlets,
which were hanging at his saddle bow,
managed somehow to latch or bolt the
fastenings of them, slipped down his visor,
and took the hilt of his sword in one hand
and the sheath in the other and loosened
the blade in the sheath. He had hardly
done this when the horse shied violently
and reared; and out of the thicket on the
near side of the road (I suppose) something
shot up in front of him on the saddle. We
all drew in our breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don't be frightened, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Wag to the youngest girl, who had given a
sort of jump. &ldquo;He's quite safe this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I must say it did not look like it. The
beast that had leapt on to the saddle was
tearing with its claws, drawing back its head
and driving it forward again with horrid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
force against the visor, and was at such
close quarters that the knight could not
possibly either draw or use his sword. It
was a horrible beast, too; evidently a young
dragon. As it sat on the saddle-bow, its
head was just about on a level with the
knight's. It had four short legs with long
toes and claws. It clung to the saddle
with the hind feet and tore with the fore
feet, as I said. Its head was rather long,
and had two pointed ears and two small
sharp horns. Besides, it had bat wings,
with which it buffeted the knight, but its
tail was short. I don't know whether it
had been bitten or cut off in some previous
fight. It was all of a mustard-yellow colour.
The knight was for the moment having a
bad time of it, for the horse was plunging
and the dragon doing its very worst.
The crisis was not long, though. The knight
took hold of the right wing with both hands
and tore the membrane upwards to the
root, like parchment. It bled yellow blood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and the dragon gave a grating scream.
Then he clutched it hard by the neck and
managed to wrench it away from its hold
on the saddle; and when it was in the air,
he whirled its body, heavy as it was, first
over his back and then forwards again,
and its neck-bone, I suppose, broke, for it
was quite limp when he cast it down. He
looked down at it for a little, and seeing it
stir, he got off, with the rein over his arm,
drew his sword, cut the head off, and kicked
it away some yards. The next thing he
did was to push up his visor, look upward,
mutter something I could not well hear,
and cross himself; after which he said aloud,
&ldquo;Where man finds one of a brood, he may
look for more,&rdquo; mounted, turned his horse's
head and galloped off the way he had come.</p>

<p>We had not followed him far through the
wood when&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bother!&rdquo; said Wag, &ldquo;there's the bell&rdquo;;
and he reached over and slid back the knobs
in the frame, and the knight stopped.</p>

I was full of questions, but there was no
time to put them. Good-nights had to be
said quickly, and Father Wag saw me out
of the front door.</p>

<p>I set out on what seemed a considerable
walk across the rough grass towards the
enormous building in which I lived. I suppose
I did not really take many minutes
about getting to the path; and as I stepped
on to it&mdash;rather carefully, for it was a
longish way down&mdash;why, without any shock
or any odd feeling, I was my own size
again. And I went to bed pondering much
upon the events of the day.</p>

<hr/><div style="margin-top: 3em;"></div>

<p>Well, I began this communication by saying
that I was going to explain to you
how it was that I &ldquo;heard something from
the owls,&rdquo; and I think I have explained
how it is that I am able to say that I have
done so. Exactly what it was that you
and I were talking about when I mentioned
the owls, I dare say neither of us remembers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
As you can see, I have had more exciting
experiences than merely conversing with
them&mdash;interesting, and, I think, unusual as
that is. I have not, of course, told you
nearly all there is to tell, but perhaps I
have said enough for the present. More, if
you should wish it, another time.</p>

<p>As to present conditions. To-day there is
a slight coolness between Wisp and the cat.
He made his way into a mouse-hole which
she was watching, and enticed her close up
to it by scratchings and other sounds, and
then, when she came quite near (taking
great trouble, of course, to make no noise
whatever), he put his head out and blew
in her face, which affronted her very much.
However, I believe I have persuaded her
that he meant no harm.</p>

<p>The room is rather full of them to-night.
Wag and most of the rest are rehearsing a
play which they mean to present before I
go. Slim, who happens not to be wanted
for a time, is man&oelig;uvring on the table,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
facing me, and is trying to produce a
portrait of me which shall be a little
less libellous than his first effort. He has
just now shown me the final production,
with which he is greatly pleased. I am not.</p>


<p>Farewell. I am, with the usual expressions
of regard,</p>

<div style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 120px;">
